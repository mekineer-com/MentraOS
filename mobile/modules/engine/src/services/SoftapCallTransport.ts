/**
 * @fileoverview Sequences a SoftAP call. Sequencing only — no sockets, no peers, no BLE.
 *
 * The glasses open a hotspot, the host joins it while retaining cellular or Ethernet internet, and the
 * glasses publish WebRTC straight to a listener on the phone. Cloudflare is not involved at all.
 *
 * The order below is the whole point of this file, and one step in it is load-bearing:
 *
 *   hotspot on -> scoped join -> ACS join (binds the listener and arms the raw outputs)
 *     -> glasses publish -> WHIP negotiation -> first frame -> LIVE
 *
 * Publishing must come after the ACS join, not before. `LIVE` means a frame reached ACS, so if the
 * glasses start publishing first, decoded video and audio can arrive before the raw outgoing
 * streams exist and the first frames are dropped by whatever happens to be null at the time. That
 * is not a lifecycle anyone designed; making the order explicit is what removes it.
 *
 * Ownership is deliberately narrow. This object owns the *sequence* and nothing else: the meeting
 * session owns the WHIP listener and the peer, `PhoneStreamCoordinator` owns the publisher, and
 * `localNetworkTransport` owns the scoped network. Every step therefore has exactly one owner that
 * can tear it down, which is what makes leaving mid-join safe.
