/**
 * PhoneStreamCoordinator — owns all local-miniapp streaming on the phone.
 *
 * Architecture:
 *   miniapp → SDK → LocalMiniappRuntime → coordinator
 *           coordinator → BluetoothSdk (BLE → glasses publisher)
 *           coordinator ↔ cloudStreamApi (managed only, cloud-v2 runtime provisioning)
 *           coordinator → status listeners → routed back to miniapp(s)
 *
 * Single-stream constraint:
 *   At most ONE stream is active across all miniapps. The exception is that
 *   multiple miniapps can subscribe to a single managed stream that's already
 *   running — Cloudflare muxes one ingest into many viewers, so subscribers
 *   share the same playback URLs. Refcounted; teardown happens when the last
 *   subscriber releases.
 *
 * Status routing:
 *   Glasses publisher status arrives over BLE as `stream_status` events with
 *   a `streamId`. The coordinator's `owns(streamId)` lookup lets MantleManager
 *   route phone-owned status events here (not to cloud). For managed streams,
 *   we additionally poll Cloudflare's live-input status every 5s to surface
 *   what the OTHER end of the pipe sees.
 *
 * Important: this is the ONLY place that mints `streamId`s for phone-owned
 * streams. We use a `phone-` prefix so they're trivially distinguishable from
 * cloud-minted managed-stream resource IDs in logs.
 *
 * BLE link loss is a SUSPENDED state, not a failure:
 *   ASG owns the ten-second phone/controller liveness deadline. The coordinator
 *   observes link suspension, retains cloud resources briefly for reconciliation,
 *   and never uses missing JavaScript heartbeats as evidence of publisher failure.
 *   An explicit stop that could not reach BLE is sent on the next reconnect.
