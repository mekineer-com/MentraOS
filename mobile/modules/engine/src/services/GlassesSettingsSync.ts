/**
 * Glasses settings sync — engine-owned. Keeps the connected glasses in sync with

 * `engine.glasses.settings.set()` (and any other settings-store write) reaches the
 * device for ANY host — not just the first-party Mentra app, where this used to live
 * in MantleManager.
 *
 * Two triggers:
 *   1. on change — push the keys that changed.
 *   2. on (re)connect — push the FULL set, so a freshly-connected device gets the
 *      phone's current settings (not just future changes).
 *
 * Started by `engine.start()`. Idempotent.
