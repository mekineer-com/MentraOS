/**
 * The wait a new SoftAP call does on the previous one's cleanup.
 *
 * Starting a call, stopping it before it finishes, and starting it again used to report "Cannot
 * start glasses hotspot" and then fail the scoped join with the SSID missing from the scan. Both
 * symptoms are the same cause: the second attempt raised a hotspot while the first attempt's
 * `setHotspotState(false)` was still in flight, so the teardown of call N landed on call N+1.
 *
 * The rule this encodes is that the barrier is the *only* thing that decides when the next call
 * may proceed, and it opens on evidence rather than on a clock. A timeout that says "long enough,
 * probably safe" reintroduces exactly the race it was added to prevent, so there is deliberately
 * no deadline here: a cleanup that never finishes holds the next call back forever, visibly,
 * which is a bug someone can see and fix. The only thing time is used for is deciding whether the
 * wait is worth mentioning — the common restart clears in a microtask, and a status line that
 * flashed on every Start would teach the wearer to ignore the one time it mattered.
