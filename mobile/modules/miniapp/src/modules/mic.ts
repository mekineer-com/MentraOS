/**
 * @fileoverview MicModule — low-level audio input subscriptions.
 *
 * Mirrors cloud SDK v3's MicManager naming. Houses raw audio chunks + VAD;
 * transcription and translation hoisted to top-level (`session.transcription`
 * / `session.translation`) in the v3-alignment round so authors don't have to
 * mentally model "transcription is a microphone thing" — it's just a
 * top-level domain. This module was called `MicrophoneModule` /
 * `session.microphone` before that round.
 *
 * Audio *output* (TTS, file playback) lives on `session.speaker`.
 *
 * MICROPHONE permission must be declared in miniapp.json for any of these
 * subscriptions to succeed; the phone runtime rejects with
 * PERMISSION_NOT_DECLARED otherwise.
