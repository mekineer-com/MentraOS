/**
 * Everything between "a microphone buffer arrived" and "the pacer has it", behind one lock.
 *
 * The lock is the point. Muting an audio path is not one flag: the wearer's voice is spread across
 * a delay ring, a resampler's filter history, a partial 20 ms frame, and the pacer's ring, and
 * clearing them one at a time leaves whichever stage the producer thread happened to be writing to.
 * Serializing ingest against mute is what makes "mute" mean the same thing at every stage.
 *
 * It cannot make mute instantaneous at the far end. Buffers already handed to ACS cannot be
 * recalled, so the residual tail is bounded by [UplinkSender.MAX_IN_FLIGHT] frames and measured
 * rather than assumed — see the sender's `muteTailMs`.
 *
 * @param bridge downmix/resample to the 48 kHz mono 20 ms frames ACS wants
 * @param pacer the clock-domain adapter the sender drains
 * @param delayMs how long to hold input before the bridge, for A/V alignment (0 = passthrough)
 * @param onIngest raw input plus arrival time, before the delay line, for A/V clap measurement
