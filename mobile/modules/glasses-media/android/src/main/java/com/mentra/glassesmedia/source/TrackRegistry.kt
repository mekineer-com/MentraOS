 * Dedupe WebRTC track attachments by native track id.
 * Three observer callbacks can deliver distinct Java wrappers of one track;
 * object identity cannot be used. [reset] is load-bearing: [CloudflareWhepSource.start]
 * calls stop first, and a stale claim set makes reconnect never attach a sink. SoftAP
 * WHIP renegotiate reuses the same track id (`video0`); without a reset the new peer
 * decodes frames that never reach the ACS sink.
