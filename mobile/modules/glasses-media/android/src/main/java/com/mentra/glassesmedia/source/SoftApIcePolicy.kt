/**
 * Keeps the SoftAP peer's ICE on the hotspot.
 *
 * Answering with a cellular candidate is the quiet failure mode: the glasses have no route to the
 * phone's mobile address, so ICE either fails after a full timeout or, worse, connects over some
 * other shared network and the "direct" link is a fiction. Rather than hope ICE prefers the right
 * interface, this removes the wrong ones from consideration entirely.
 *
 * [networkIgnoreMask] is a real libwebrtc knob — `PeerConnectionFactory.Options.networkIgnoreMask`
 * — unlike the socket factory the design originally assumed existed. Combined with an empty ICE
 * server list (so no srflx or relay candidate can be gathered at all) it leaves exactly one kind of
 * candidate available: a Wi-Fi host candidate, which on a phone joined to the glasses hotspot is
 * the hotspot address.
 *
 * Pure integer arithmetic, so it is unit tested rather than assumed.
