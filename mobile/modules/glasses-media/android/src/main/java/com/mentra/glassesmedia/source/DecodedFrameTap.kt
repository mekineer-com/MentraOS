/**
 * A second, optional consumer of decoded glasses video, sitting beside the ACS sender.
 *
 * The call owns this pipeline; the preview is a guest. [offer] therefore never blocks, never lets
 * a `Throwable` reach the decoder thread, and never does real work — a sink may only decide
 * whether it wants the frame, retain it, and schedule bounded work elsewhere. A preview that
 * crashes, stalls, or falls behind must cost the call nothing.
 *
 * [detach] is generation-checked because sessions overlap: a call ending late must not tear down
 * the subscription a newer call already installed.
 *
 * ## Cost with nothing attached
 *
 * With no sink and telemetry off, [offer] is one volatile read and a return. Sink, error handler
 * and the telemetry flag live in one immutable [State] so that read is the only thing the decoder
 * thread pays.
 *
 * ## Why the metrics live here
 *
 * These describe the call, not the preview. With [setTelemetryEnabled] on they are collected even
 * with no sink attached, so a preview-off run is a usable baseline for the same numbers with the
 * preview on.
