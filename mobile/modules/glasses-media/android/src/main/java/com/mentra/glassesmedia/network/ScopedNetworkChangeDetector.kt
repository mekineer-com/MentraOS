/**
 * Adds the scoped SoftAP network to libwebrtc's Android network inventory.
 *
 * ## Why this exists
 *
 * The SoftAP [Network] is requested without `NET_CAPABILITY_INTERNET` so that Android keeps ACS on
 * cellular. But stock libwebrtc's `NetworkMonitorAutoDetect` registers a request for
 * *internet-capable* networks, so it never sees this one, and ICE therefore never gathers a host
 * candidate on the hotspot subnet. Holding a scoped `Network` object is not by itself enough to make
 * libwebrtc's internally-created UDP sockets use that interface — `PeerConnectionFactory.Options`
 * exposes `networkIgnoreMask` and `disableNetworkMonitor`, not a socket factory or a network handle.
 *
 * Injecting the interface into the inventory is the supported way through: it is the same technique
 * the glasses already use for their `ap0` tethering interface in
 * `HotspotAwareNetworkChangeDetector`.
 *
 * The monitor this touches is process-wide and the libwebrtc AAR is shared with LiveKit, so the
 * takeover is scoped and reversible; [ScopedNetworkObserver] documents and enforces that contract.
 *
 * ## Why the handle is the real [Network] handle
 *
 * Two device-proven behaviours, both captured, both fatal on their own:
 *
 * Handle `0` makes `BindSocketToNetwork` return `NOT_IMPLEMENTED`, so libwebrtc binds the socket to
 * `192.168.43.x` and advertises that address. The answer is truthful. ICE checks then sit on that
 * pair with `|CR-I|-|0|0|` forever: the OS accepted the bind, and even a send-only datagram, but
 * unmarked UDP on a non-default network is not delivered. 18:56 / 19:01 runs: ACS `CONNECTED`,
 * `ingest_host_candidate onHotspot=true`, then `ingest_no_first_frame` and the glasses reporting
 * `ICE did not connect`.
 *
 * A real handle makes `android_setsocknetwork` succeed, so the socket is marked onto the scoped
 * SoftAP and ICE packets can actually leave and return. libwebrtc then rebinds to `0.0.0.0` and
 * `UDPPort` substitutes the default-route (cellular) address into the candidate:
 *
 * ```
 * Allocate ports on wlan0
 * Port[...:Net[wlan0:192.168.43.x/24:Wifi:id=5]]: Gathered candidate: Cand[...:10.48.51.x:...:host...]
 * ```
 *
 * That advertised address is what the glasses would send to, and they have no route to it. So the
 * handle is real — sockets must be marked — and [SoftApSdpGuard.pinHostAddresses] rewrites the
 * answer the glasses see back onto the scoped IP. One inventory entry, so the handle cannot collide
 * with a decoy the way `0` did when we published more than one.
 *
 * ## Status
 *
 * Whether stock libwebrtc needs this at all is exactly what the Phase 0.5 feasibility gate
 * (`SoftApFeasibilityGateTest`) measures. The gate fired on-device (see [install]), so
 * [AcsMeetingModule][com.mentra.acsmeeting.AcsMeetingModule] installs it at module creation.

         * Worse, the decoys were actively fatal. `AndroidNetworkMonitor` keys its networks by
         * *handle*, and both the hotspot and the decoys have to use [UNBINDABLE_HANDLE], so each
         * `onNetworkConnect` overwrote the previous one. Whichever arrived last was the only
         * network the monitor knew, and when that was a masked decoy the answer carried no
         * candidates at all:
         *
         * ```

         * One entry, therefore. The invariant stays structural — the only gatherable adapter is the
         * scoped SoftAP — and it no longer depends on a handle being unique.
         *
         * When the hotspot shares an interface *name* with a stock address, the scoped entry wins
