/**
 * Declarative description of the SoftAP network request.
 *
 * `NetworkRequest.Builder` cannot be constructed in a plain JVM test, so the shape of the request
 * lives here as data and [ScopedSoftApNetwork] translates it into the real builder. That makes the
 * one property this architecture depends on — that the request does **not** ask for
 * `NET_CAPABILITY_INTERNET` — assertable without a device.
 *
 * Dropping the internet capability is what keeps the phone dual-homed: Android will not promote the
 * glasses hotspot to the default network, so ACS traffic stays on cellular while media crosses the
 * local link. The other half of that guarantee is the MTK firmware patch that stops the AP
 * advertising a default route.
