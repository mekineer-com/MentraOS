/**
 * The WHIP endpoint's request handling, as a pure function.
 *
 * Everything here is decided from the request plus [IngestState]; sockets, peers and SDP generation
 * live in [WhipIngestServer]. That split exists because the interesting failures are protocol
 * failures — a second POST while a session is live, a DELETE against a stale id, a POST that
 * arrives after teardown — and those are painful to provoke through a socket and trivial to state
 * as a table.
 *
 * The glasses are the offerer and keep the WHIP client they already use against Cloudflare. Only
 * the endpoint moves onto the phone. So this implements the endpoint half of WHIP, and only the
 * parts one publisher on a private link needs: no trickle `PATCH`, no ICE restart, no auth.
