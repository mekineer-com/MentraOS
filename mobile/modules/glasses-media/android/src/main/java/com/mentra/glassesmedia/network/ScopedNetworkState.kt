/**
 * Pure lifecycle state machine for a scoped SoftAP network join.
 *
 * Split from the Android shell so the awkward parts — duplicate callbacks, callbacks arriving after
 * a cancel, a timeout racing a late `onAvailable` — are unit testable without a device. The shell
 * ([ScopedSoftApNetwork]) owns `ConnectivityManager` and forwards raw callbacks in here.
 *
 * `ConnectivityManager` gives no ordering or at-most-once guarantee: `onAvailable` can fire more
 * than once, `onCapabilitiesChanged` fires repeatedly, and callbacks from a request that was already
 * unregistered can still land. Every transition below is therefore idempotent and generation-guarded.
