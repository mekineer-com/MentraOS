/**
 * Separates the causes of "the answer carried no hotspot candidate".
 *
 * That single symptom has been produced on device by four different faults, and a coarse error code
 * cannot tell them apart — which is how one of them was misattributed and "fixed" by a change that
 * created the next. Each fault is distinguished by state that only exists at the moment of
 * gathering, so it is captured there and reduced to a [Fault] rather than inferred from logs later:
 *
 *  - the hotspot address is not in the kernel's interface table, so nothing could have gathered it
 *  - the address is there but the inventory libwebrtc holds does not contain the hotspot, or two
 *    entries share a handle so one overwrote the other
 *  - both are fine and still nothing was gathered, which leaves the socket bind
 *  - candidates were gathered, none on the hotspot, so the wrong address is being advertised
 *
 * The [Fault] is a hypothesis narrowed by observation, not a proof; the raw fields travel with it so
 * a run can be re-read without trusting the classifier.
