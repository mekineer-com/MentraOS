/**
 * Owns libwebrtc's network state for as long as a scoped SoftAP is joined, and gives it back after.
 *
 * `getActiveNetworkList` is only a snapshot. libwebrtc's process-wide monitor also keeps every
 * network it has ever been told about through [onNetworkConnect]. AutoDetect is constructed with
 * this observer and reports cellular (and leftover home Wi-Fi) throughout the ACS join that happens
 * *before* ingest starts, and those handles stay in the native list. Gathering unions the snapshot
 * with that history, which is how a correct inventory still produced a lone cellular candidate.
 *
 * ## Ownership, not filtering
 *
 * The monitor is process-wide and the libwebrtc AAR is deliberately shared with LiveKit, so this
 * cannot simply mute callbacks and walk away. The contract is explicit:
 *
 *  - **While SoftAP is joined** this observer owns the monitor. Stock connect/disconnect callbacks
 *    are suppressed (but *recorded*), every handle outside the SoftAP inventory is disconnected,
 *    and exactly that inventory is connected.
 *  - **When the hotspot goes away** ownership is handed back by [restore]: the synthetic entry is
 *    disconnected and every stock network whose callback was suppressed is replayed, so a WHEP or
 *    LiveKit connection started afterwards sees real networks. Resuming pass-through alone is not
 *    enough — the networks it never heard about would stay missing until the OS happened to
 *    re-announce them.
 *
 * Restoration is driven from both directions, because either may come first: [publish] runs on
 * every inventory read, and each stock callback checks too, since after teardown the OS may be the
 * only thing still talking to us.
