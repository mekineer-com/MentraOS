/**
 * Keeps the phone's internet on cellular across the hotspot join, and says so honestly.
 *
 * Joining the glasses' SoftAP takes the phone off office Wi-Fi. Cellular becomes the default route,
 * and on device it was not yet validated when that happened: `scoped_network_available` at 18:04:57
 * was followed by a 30 s gap before ACS even began its native join, then a 40 s step timeout, with
 * device-wide DNS and TLS deadline failures throughout. ACS needs the internet during that window,
 * so the transition has to be deliberate rather than hoped for.
 *
 * ## What a request does and does not buy
 *
 * `requestNetwork(CELLULAR + INTERNET)` asks Android to bring cellular up and keeps it up while the
 * request is held. It does **not** guarantee the network is validated, and it does not switch the
 * default route on any particular schedule. So this class does two separate things, and neither is
 * inferred from the other:
 *
 *  - [awaitValidatedCellular] holds the request and waits for `NET_CAPABILITY_VALIDATED` on the
 *    cellular network itself. Run *before* leaving Wi-Fi, so a phone with no working cellular fails
 *    with a reason instead of stranding ACS on a hotspot with no internet.
 *  - [awaitValidatedDefault] asks what the app's actual default network is now, and whether it is
 *    validated. Run *after* the hotspot join, because that is when the default can change.
 *
 * Holding is not the same as *using*, which is what [bindProcessToCellular] is for, and why that one
 * has a deliberately short leash.
 *
 * Bounded, released on every exit, and idempotent: teardown calls [release] without checking.

     * Being *on* an internet-less hotspot is not the same as Android routing around it. With the
     * scoped SoftAP joined, `getActiveNetwork` reports validated cellular and unbound sockets still
     * fail: ACS sat in CONNECTING for 91 s and gave up with code 408, and the app's own cloud
     * websocket dropped mid-call. The one join that reached CONNECTED — in under four seconds — was
     * pinned continuously from before the hotspot join.
     *
     * Pinning does not make ACS *fast*: a cold `createCallAgent` measured 30 s pinned to cellular,
     * about the same as unpinned. It decides whether the call connects at all, not how quickly.
     *
     * ## Hold it continuously; open one hole
     *
     * This marks *every* socket the process opens while it is in effect, and `Network.bindSocket`
     * has no `ServerSocket` overload to undo it. A WHIP listener opened while pinned accepted on
     * `192.168.43.79` but answered out the radio, so the glasses' SYN drew no reply at all and
     * publish died on a 10 s connect timeout.
     *
     * Pinning late — after the hotspot join, just before the Teams join — does not work either:
     * sockets keep the mark they were created with, so ACS re-binds its signalling on the broken
     * route in the unpinned window and never recovers. So the pin is held from sign-in through
     * teardown, and [unbindProcess] opens a hole only for the moment the WHIP `ServerSocket` is
     * created. ICE is unaffected throughout: libwebrtc re-marks its own sockets onto the scoped
     * network handle that `ScopedNetworkChangeDetector.toNetworkInformation` publishes.
     *
     * Anything that pins must unpin — via [unbindProcess], or via [release] on teardown.
