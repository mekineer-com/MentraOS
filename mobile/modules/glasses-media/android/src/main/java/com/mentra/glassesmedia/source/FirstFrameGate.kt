 * Guards the promotion to [SourceState.LIVE] on the first video frame.
 *
 * `LIVE` used to fire on the WHEP answer, which is three hops and several
 * seconds before ACS is handed a frame — long enough that Mentra Call told the
 * wearer video was restored 7.5 s before Teams got one. It now means a frame
 * reached the sink, and an answer that never produces one expires instead of
 * reading healthy forever behind a frozen last frame.
 *
 * Armed per peer generation so a frame — or a deadline — belonging to a peer
 * being torn down can neither promote nor fail its replacement.
