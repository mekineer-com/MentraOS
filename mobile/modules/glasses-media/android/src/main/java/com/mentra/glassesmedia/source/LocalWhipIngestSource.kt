/**
 * Receives glasses media straight off the SoftAP, with no Cloudflare hop.
 *
 * This is the same job [CloudflareWhepSource] does with the roles reversed. There the phone offers
 * and Cloudflare answers; here the glasses offer — using the WHIP client they already ship — and
 * the phone answers on a listener bound to its own hotspot address. Keeping the glasses as the
 * offerer is deliberate: it is by far the harder device to debug, and this way its publish path is
 * unchanged apart from the URL it POSTs to and the absence of a STUN server.
 *
 * Three things make the local link work, and all three matter:
 *
 *  - an empty ICE server list, so no server-reflexive or relay candidate can even be gathered;
 *  - [SoftApIcePolicy.networkIgnoreMask], so cellular and VPN adapters are excluded from gathering
 *    and cannot be selected over the hotspot;
 *  - [com.mentra.glassesmedia.network.ScopedNetworkChangeDetector], so libwebrtc sees the hotspot at
 *    all — its stock monitor only watches internet-capable networks, and this one deliberately is
 *    not.
 *
 * Past the decoder nothing is special, so frames and PCM go through the shared [DecodedTrackRelay].
 *
 * The session owns this object and this object owns the [WhipIngestServer] and the peer. The
 * orchestrator only sequences; it never holds the listener. That keeps a single answer to "who
 * tears the publisher down", which is what makes leave-during-negotiation safe.
