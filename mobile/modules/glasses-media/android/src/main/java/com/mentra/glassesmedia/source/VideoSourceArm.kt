/**
 * Investigation arm. SYNTHETIC bypasses glasses, Cloudflare, WHEP and decode.
 * Ships as WHEP. Flip locally to run the experiment; do not commit SYNTHETIC.
 *
 * [decoderMode] TEXTURE is the production default (shared EGL, MediaCodec to
 * Surface). BYTE_BUFFER is the A/B: no shared context, CPU planes, no
 * glReadPixels. 720p BYTE_BUFFER on SM_S948U decoded on hardware with
 * i420P95=0, but wire/codec never attached and busy drops climbed. Do not
 * commit BYTE_BUFFER until a same-phone 540p A/B clears the campaign gates.
 *
 * [zeroCopy] hands WebRTC I420 planes straight to ACS when they are tight and
 * retainable. Ships off. Do not commit true.
 *
 * [pixelFormat] I420 is the production default. NV12 is the encoder-flip A/B:
 * advertise and send biplanar NV12 in case ACS picks a hardware H.264
 * encoder. Revert unless `codecName` leaves `h264 sw`. Do not commit NV12
 * on a failed flip.

   * The rate we declare to ACS.
   *
   * CLAMP_TO_SOFTWARE_CEILING pins it to [VideoProfile.SOFTWARE_ENCODER_FPS]
   * whenever the profile asks for more. It was the default on the strength of
   * soaks that reported `codecName: "h264 sw"` alongside wire ≈ 8.8 fps, read as
   * an encoder ceiling. Two things in the device logs say it was never the
   * encoder.
   *
   * 720p15 and 540p15 both reported ~8.8 fps. 540p is 52% of the pixels of 720p,
   * so a CPU-bound encoder would have been close to twice as fast at the smaller
   * size; a limit that does not move with pixel count is not a pixel cost. And
   * once [FramePacer] delivered a steady cadence, `wire` tracked what we handed
   * ACS — 6.9 against 7.1 admitted — which is an encoder keeping up, not one
   * saturating. Both of those soaks ran through a send path that could not hold a
   * rate, so what they measured was our delivery.
   *
   * ADVERTISE_REQUESTED runs the configuration that was never actually tried:
   * declare the profile's own fps and let the corrected pacer deliver it. Read
   * the `P7 rate` verdict for what binds; it distinguishes an encoder that cannot
   * keep up from a rate controller starving one that can, and those two want
   * opposite fixes.
