/**
 * Names what is holding the outgoing frame rate down.
 *
 * The fps question kept being answered by inference: a soak put ~8.8 fps on the
 * wire, so the ACS software encoder "holds 8.8 fps". That does not follow. At
 * least four different things produce a low wire rate, they are trivial to tell
 * apart from numbers we already collect, and two of them want opposite fixes —
 * cutting resolution rescues an encoder that is genuinely CPU-bound and makes a
 * bitrate-starved stream strictly worse.
 *
 * So this prints the answer instead of leaving it to be guessed:
 *
 * - [Bound.SOURCE_SHORT] the glasses are not sending enough frames. Nothing
 *   downstream of the decoder can raise the rate.
 * - [Bound.PACER_SHORT] our own gate is the limit — it admitted fewer frames
 *   than we advertised while the source had plenty. This is what a greedy
 *   `FramePacer` did: 14.6 fps in, 7.3 out, against an advertised 8.
 * - [Bound.ENCODER_SHORT] ACS took the frames and put fewer on the wire while
 *   the CPU was busy. The real encoder ceiling. Cut pixels.
 * - [Bound.BITRATE_STARVED] ACS took the frames and put fewer on the wire with
 *   CPU to spare and the bitrate far under the budget we granted. The rate
 *   controller is throttling an encoder that could keep up. Cutting fps or
 *   pixels here makes it worse; fix delivery consistency.
 * - [Bound.CAP_BOUND] every frame is on the wire and the bitrate is pressed
 *   against the ceiling we granted. Nothing is broken; the grant is simply the
 *   limit, so the picture cannot get sharper until the number does.
