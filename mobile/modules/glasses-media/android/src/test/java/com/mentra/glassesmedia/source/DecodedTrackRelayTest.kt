 * This code was previously inline in [CloudflareWhepSource] with no coverage at all, and it is
 * decided per frame on the decode thread. Both directions are invisible when wrong: an unnecessary
 * scale is a silent per-frame CPU cost, and a skipped one is a plane-size mismatch at the ACS
 * sender rather than an exception here.
