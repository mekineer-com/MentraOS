# Glasses media transport

Native receivers, WHIP publishers and network helpers shared by the Mentra App. This library has no ACS SDK dependency. ACS consumes decoded media for calls; managed WebRTC streams feed the same decoded video and PCM to `PhoneWhipPublisher`.

- Android: the existing `GlassesMediaSource`, local WHIP and WHEP receivers, scoped SoftAP networking, decoded I420/PCM delivery, and transport diagnostics moved here. The ACS session and raw outgoing streams remain in `acs-meeting`.
- iOS: `DecodedGlassesMediaSource` delivers `CVPixelBuffer` video and interleaved PCM16. `LocalWhipIngestSource` answers the glasses' existing WHIP client; `WhepVideoSource` retains the cloud subscription path.
- `GlassesHotspotNetwork` uses the same persistent `NEHotspotConfiguration` join as gallery transfers. Wi-Fi carries the glasses link; cellular carries the call. It verifies the joined SSID and `en0` address, reports network loss, and retains a cancelled join until the uncancellable system callback has been cleaned up.

The publisher owns its outgoing encoders, audio policy, and destination. Receivers do not open the phone microphone or play the glasses microphone locally. iOS uses a receive-only audio device to drive decoded PCM delivery without changing the app's audio session.

## Lifecycle

The host signs in, enables the glasses hotspot, joins it, prepares the receiver and publisher, then tells the glasses to publish to the returned `ingestUrl`. A successful listener bind is not a live stream: `live` requires a decoded video frame. iOS waits for full ICE gathering and returns only actual host candidates on the hotspot interface. Requests and queued media are bounded.

Stop the glasses publisher before stopping the receiver and releasing the network. Await `LocalWhipIngestSource.stop(completion:)` before reusing resources on iOS. Android owners discarding a receiver use `close()` to drain HTTP negotiation and release its retained factory and EGL resources. It cancels pending offers, closes the peer and HTTP listener, and drains teardown before completing. A local source must not silently restart onto a new port; the host must coordinate any new URL with the glasses. WHEP can rebuild its existing URL.

## Verification

```sh
swift test --package-path mobile/modules/glasses-media/ios/CoreKit
swift test --package-path mobile/modules/acs-meeting/ios/PolicyKit
./scripts/check-android-compile.sh bluetooth-sdk :mentra-glasses-media:testDebugUnitTest :mentra-acs-meeting:testDebugUnitTest
```

After iOS prebuild and `pod install`, compile the actual shared-library consumer:

```sh
xcodebuild -project mobile/ios/Pods/Pods.xcodeproj -target AcsMeeting \
  -configuration Debug -sdk iphonesimulator -arch arm64 \
  ONLY_ACTIVE_ARCH=YES CODE_SIGNING_ALLOWED=NO build
```

Before merging/releasing, exercise iPhone + glasses: first-use local-network permission and hotspot prompts; join/admit/mute/leave; music/camera sounds; rapid Start/Cancel/Start during sign-in, hotspot join, and WHIP negotiation; hotspot loss; repeated joins; screen-off/background streaming; and a sustained call while measuring latency, audio/video alignment, and thermal behavior. Screen-off operation and background gallery transfers already exist in the Mentra App; these checks qualify the new media pipeline. A simulator build and loopback HTTP tests cannot establish physical Wi-Fi/cellular routing or camera behavior.

## Managed WebRTC relay

`PhoneStreamCoordinator` provisions Cloudflare and owns subscribers for the entire route:

```text
Glasses -- video-only WHIP over SoftAP --> shared receiver --> phone WHIP publisher --> Cloudflare
Glasses MCU -- BLE LC3 --> phone PCM decoder ----------------------^
```

Only `ingest: "whip"` selects this route. Default SRT and explicit RTMP continue publishing directly from the glasses. WHIP never falls back to SRT/RTMP when Cloudflare omits its WHIP URL. The phone needs mobile data; the glasses need no internet Wi-Fi credentials. Livestreamer's Stream Here path skips its glasses Wi-Fi setup gate accordingly.

`MentraGlassesMediaRelay.prepare` joins the persistent hotspot, prepares both native peers, and returns a local WHIP URL for the BLE start command. Cloudflare credentials stay on the phone. Video queues hold at most one frame; decoded PCM is downmixed/resampled into a bounded 200ms, 48kHz mono queue. WebRTC re-encodes both tracks. No phone microphone is captured. Android uses the WebRTC library's external AudioRecord buffer mode; iOS uses a custom `RTCAudioDevice`.

On Android hosts with microphone pinning and native PCM input, managed streams use the same BLE LC3 capture path as ACS SoftAP calls. An engine-owned `livestream` microphone session requests continuous glasses PCM; it leaves the configured gain in force and disables the call-specific loudness gate. The glasses receive `captureAudio: false`, avoiding SoC microphone capture and audio encoding, while the phone publishes video plus LC3-derived audio to Cloudflare. Attempt-scoped callbacks and native PCM gating reject late audio after stop/retry. Explicit `captureAudio: false` disables audio entirely. iOS and older hosts retain WHIP audio, matching ACS capability gating. ACS's measured 170ms audio delay is specific to its outgoing pipeline and is not applied to the Cloudflare publisher without calibration.

Android's process-wide network inventory exposes both the scoped hotspot and real cellular handles during a relay. Per-factory masks keep the receiver on Wi-Fi and the publisher off Wi-Fi; signaling also uses the cellular network's socket factory and DNS. ACS retains its existing hotspot-only inventory. iOS uses corresponding per-factory masks after validating the cellular default route.

The iOS internet publisher posts its offer on the first server-reflexive candidate, complete ICE gathering, or a 1.5-second gather deadline, matching the glasses publisher's STUN policy. It posts once and ignores late triggers after stop. The local SoftAP receiver still waits for complete host-only gathering. Incident logs record the outgoing negotiation stage, candidate counts, HTTP result and first decoded video frame without SDP or publish credentials.

Android temporarily lifts the cellular process pin while creating the local WHIP listener, then restores it before starting the outgoing publisher. Otherwise the listener inherits the cellular socket mark and cannot reply to the glasses. The outgoing audio callback supplies its own PCM frame clock: WebRTC's external-recording mode does not pace callbacks and reports zero captured bytes, so the callback fills the entire buffer and waits for the next frame interval without opening the phone microphone.

An attempt-specific ID isolates late callbacks and glasses status. Reconnect tears down the glasses publisher, both phone peers and hotspot before rebuilding against the same provisioned input. Three retries bound consecutive failures; a minute of stable streaming renews the retry budget. Last-subscriber stop cancels startup/backoff, awaits native cleanup and disables the hotspot. Failed cleanup retains ownership and can be retried by stop. BLE-unreachable stop/hotspot commands are deferred until reconnection. ACS and managed streaming share a hotspot reservation. Native media queues keep running when the UI is backgrounded; Android holds a partial wake lock and uses the engine's background timers for retry/readiness.

Device qualification for this outgoing pipeline must include Android and iPhone: audio/video playback on the provisioned WHEP URL, mute/video-only capture, last-subscriber stop, cancellation at each setup step, cellular/hotspot/BLE loss and recovery, repeated starts, screen-off/background operation and a sustained thermal/audio-sync run. Unit tests and platform compilation cover lifecycle/format contracts; they do not establish those hardware results.
