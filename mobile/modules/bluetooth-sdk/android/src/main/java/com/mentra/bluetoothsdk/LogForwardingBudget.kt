/**
 * Bounds how many native log lines per second the module hands to the JavaScript runtime.
 *
 * Every event the module emits pins a JNI global reference until the JavaScript thread
 * drains it, and the process-wide table holds about 51,200 references. Native code can log
 * faster than a busy JavaScript thread drains, so an unbounded log stream aborts the process
 * instead of merely lagging. Lines over the budget are withheld from JavaScript only; the
 * native console still has every one of them. The first line forwarded after a shortfall
 * reports how many were withheld, so the gap is visible in the JavaScript stream.
