/**
 * Process-wide barrier between Mentra Live GATT teardown and the next connection attempt.
 *
 * Android can keep the physical link alive after a disconnect request until it delivers the
 * disconnected callback. Starting another GATT session before that callback can reuse the old link,
 * including its already-consumed MTU exchange. Callers queue connection work here and release it
 * only after every outstanding teardown has completed or timed out. A newer deferred connection
 * replaces the previous one so reconnect retries cannot start multiple GATT sessions together.
