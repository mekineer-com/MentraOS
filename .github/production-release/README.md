# Production release runbook

This is the employee procedure for promoting one completed coordinated beta to
production. It covers Cloud V2 and the Mentra App on iOS and Android.

The Bluetooth SDK Starter Kit example app is outside the promotion state
machine. Its production candidates are built by a separate workflow keyed on
the promoted beta (see "Bluetooth example" below): it is distributed through
a public TestFlight link and a dedicated closed Play track and is never
submitted for App Review or released through a store. Do not add the example
app manually to a promotion attempt.

The example app is also its own release notion in the coordinated beta. A beta
is complete, and promotable, when `finalize` writes `mentra-release-<beta>.json`
for Cloud V2, the Mentra App, the Engine, and the Bluetooth SDK. The Starter
Kit examples are then built against that finalized beta and recorded
separately as `mentra-example-release-<beta>.json`, the "finalized Mentra
Bluetooth example". An example build or store publish that fails never makes
the beta incomplete and never blocks a promotion.

For dev and staging, `coordinated-release.yml` publishes the core release,
dispatches `coordinated-example-release.yml`, and posts the core notification.
The examples workflow has its own per-branch concurrency group; Starter Kit
builds, example store distribution, and docs never hold the next core release.
It restores the originating run's exact plan and finalized manifest instead of
allocating another version. A small path-filtered push trigger registers the
new workflow on dev/staging; only dispatch events perform example release work.

Docs require the finalized core release, the matching Starter Kit APK, and the
example TestFlight result. Google Play publication and example finalization do
not gate docs, because the Android documentation links to the GitHub APK.
The complete example release record still requires both stores to succeed.

To recover examples/docs without republishing the core, dispatch on the same
channel as the original run (including old combined runs that failed only their
example jobs):

```bash
gh workflow run coordinated-example-release.yml --ref dev \
  -f source_run_id=35173449955
```

The loader rejects a different repository/channel, an unsuccessful core
finalizer, expired or ambiguous artifacts, and mismatched release evidence.
Starter Kit and store steps retain their existing exact-version reuse behavior;
this is not a docs-only dispatch. A Play failure will still mark the examples
workflow failed while allowing its docs deployment to succeed. To retry docs
alone after an export/deployment failure, rerun that failed job.

The process is resumable. It records immutable state in a draft GitHub release
named `mentra-production-promotion-vX.Y.Z-attempt-N`. Store review may take days;
no GitHub runner waits for it.

## Safety rules

- Promote only a completed coordinated beta whose MentraOS source already
  contains `main`. If `main` has production-only commits, back-merge them into
  `staging` and complete a new beta before promotion.
- Start only after the selected beta's exact sources are in `main`.
- Never patch or re-sign a beta binary. Production mobile candidates are rebuilt
  from the frozen source with production configuration.
- Never edit or replace an existing promotion asset. Retry the same phase or
  start a new attempt.
- Never paste tokens, secrets, private keys, customer data, or raw production
  configuration into evidence.
- Cloud deployment, candidate upload, store submission, and public release use
  separate protected GitHub environments. A distinct approver is required for
  production Cloud and public release.
- A green readiness endpoint is not mobile acceptance. Both iOS and Android
  device evidence are required.
- Stop on any coordinate mismatch. Do not choose a build in a store by date or
  appearance.

## Release order and compatibility contract

The required order is:

1. Current Mobile N source, configured as a non-promotable lab build, works with
   staging Cloud N+1.
2. Deploy Cloud N+1 to production.
3. The actual Mobile N currently installed from both public stores works with
   production Cloud N+1.
4. Build Mobile N+1 from source with production configuration.
5. The exact TestFlight and Play internal candidates work with Cloud N+1.
6. Submit those exact candidates, wait for review, and release progressively.

Mobile N+1 compatibility with Cloud N is not a normal gate. Customers will
inevitably keep Mobile N after Cloud N+1 is deployed, so Mobile N with Cloud N+1
is mandatory. Step 1 needs the current app's source provenance; the first
coordinated promotion has none and keeps only step 3 (see "Phase 1").

## One-time repository and account setup

Configure these GitHub environments:

| Environment                    | Purpose                             | Required protection                        |
| ------------------------------ | ----------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| `production-store-status`      | Read-only store inventory/status    | Store credentials; no public mutation      |
| `production-cloud-status`      | Cloud configuration preflight       | Porter credential; no deployment approval  |
| `production-compatibility-lab` | Non-promotable Mobile N uploads     | Required reviewer; staging target only     |
| `production-cloud`             | Cloud V2 deployment                 | Required reviewer different from initiator |
| `production-mobile-candidates` | Production-signed candidate uploads | Required reviewer; no public release       |
| `production-store-submission`  | App review submission               | Required reviewer                          |
| `production-store-release`     | Public release and rollout evidence | Required reviewer different from initiator |
| `production-packages`          | Stage plain package versions        | Required reviewer                          |
| `production-packages-release`  | npm latest, Maven Central, SwiftPM  | Required reviewer different from initiator |

Required secrets are the existing Porter, App Store Connect, Google Play,
Android upload-signing, Apple Match, Doppler, Mapbox, and Sentry credentials
used by the reusable release workflows. Operators do not download them locally.

Before launch week, verify the Mentra App record in App Store Connect and Play
Console:

- agreements, tax, banking, compliance, privacy, export, data safety, content
  rating, countries, support/privacy URLs, screenshots, and listing copy;
- App Review contact, a non-expiring demo account, and complete reviewer steps;
- internal tester membership and dedicated test devices;
- a `Mentra Compatibility Lab` internal TestFlight group;
- automatic TestFlight distribution is off for the production groups;
- managed publishing is enabled in Google Play; and
- alerting, dashboards, incident channel, release owner, QA owner, approver, and
  rollback owner are staffed for the release window.

## Operator commands

First, from a clean, up-to-date `staging` checkout, promote the exact commits
recorded by the completed coordinated beta:

```bash
git switch staging
git pull --ff-only origin staging
./scripts/production-release.mjs promote --beta X.Y.Z-beta.N
```

This creates and merges the MentraOS `staging` to `main` pull request. It only
advances branch history. It does not touch the Starter Kit repository, deploy
Cloud, upload mobile apps, submit stores, or create production-promotion state.
It fails before opening the pull request if the selected beta does not already
contain the `main` head.

Then, from a clean, up-to-date MentraOS `main` checkout:

```bash
git switch main
git pull --ff-only origin main
./scripts/production-release.mjs start --beta X.Y.Z-beta.N
./scripts/production-release.mjs status --release X.Y.Z
```

`status` is the source of truth for the current state and next action. Use
`--json` for machine-readable output. Use `--attempt N` when inspecting an older
attempt. Use `status --refresh` to dispatch the read-only store status workflow.
Stable package publication is not part of `next`; see "Stable packages" below.

Mutating commands require typing the release identity, or `--yes` in an already
reviewed non-interactive procedure. The CLI never reads production credentials
and never calls Porter or a store directly.

Two human gates may be deferred with `defer --check NAME --reason TEXT`:
`production-mobile-n-compatibility` (Phase 5) and
`production-mobile-candidate-acceptance` (Phase 8). Both precede store review,
which takes days, and neither guards anything user-facing on its own. A
deferral records who deferred and why, moves the promotion on, and leaves the
gate open: `attest` the same check later, at any state before public release
approval, and `release` refuses to proceed while a deferral is unresolved.
`status` lists the deferred gates still to attest.

## Build numbers

Every store build number of the family, the Mentra App's iOS build and Android
version code and the ASG client's version code, is derived from the family
base version: `MAJOR × 100,000,000 + MINOR × 1,000,000 + PATCH × 10,000 +
sequence`, with major between 2 and 20 and minor and patch at most 99. Design:
`notes/superpowers/specs/2026-09-14-family-build-numbers.md`.

Sequences restart at 1 for every family. Each coordinated run allocates one
sequence from the family's build container (`mentra-builds-vX.Y.Z`): the next
free number above every `mentra-build-number-<code>.json` marker recorded
there, and records its own marker, which names its owner, before building; a
retry finds its own marker and reuses the number. The ASG client reuses its
published code when its sources are unchanged and takes exactly the run's
number when rebuilt. Production candidates, the production Bluetooth
example and a compatibility-lab rebuild allocate the same way, from their
family's container. Release sequences stay below 3,000; the band above is
reserved for local and pull-request builds.

The Mentra App's 3.1.0 betas and the first 3.2.0 dev builds predate the formula
and carry a flat `310000000 + run number`, above their families' windows.
Android testers on the Play beta or internal track with one of those builds
reinstall the app once to rejoin the release train; glasses are unaffected.

## Phase 1 - select and freeze

`start` dispatches `production-release-prepare.yml`. It only reads completed
release/store records and creates the draft promotion evidence container. It
does not deploy, upload, submit, or release anything.

Preparation fails if:

- the beta is incomplete or its immutable artifacts fail verification;
- its source is not contained in `main`;
- the public Mentra App does not match the previous production manifest;
- store build numbers cannot be allocated monotonically; or
- a published `mentra-vX.Y.Z` release exists but its record does not describe
  the public Mentra App.

When no published `mentra-vX.Y.Z` release exists yet (the first coordinated
promotion), the public Mentra App predates this system and cannot be rebuilt
from provenance. Preparation then freezes the app exactly as both stores serve
it (`currentMentraApp.provenance` is `store-observed`, with the App Store build
number and the Play production version code), publishes the store inventory
into the attempt container, and creates the initial record directly in
`staging-compatible`: Phase 2 does not exist for that attempt because there is
no source to build a lab app from. Phase 5 still verifies the real store app
against production Cloud N+1. Every later promotion finds the `mentra-vX.Y.Z`
release this one publishes and runs Phase 2 normally.

If preparation stops before `status` can find an initial state record, rerun
`start` with the same beta. That interrupted bootstrap may leave an empty draft
attempt, but it has not deployed Cloud, uploaded an app, or consumed a store
build coordinate. Once `status` returns `selected` (or `staging-compatible` for
a first coordinated promotion), resume that attempt with `next` rather than
starting another one.

## Phase 2 - Mobile N against staging Cloud N+1

This phase only exists when the current production app has coordinated
provenance. `status` shows a first coordinated promotion already in
`staging-compatible`; continue with Phase 3.

Run the next action and watch it to completion:

```bash
./scripts/production-release.mjs next --release X.Y.Z
```

After `production-compatibility-lab` approval, this rebuilds the exact frozen
current-production Mobile N source with the allocated lab build number and
staging configuration. It uploads iOS as TestFlight Internal Only to `Mentra
Compatibility Lab` and Android through Play Internal App Sharing, then records
the App Store coordinate, Play download URL, source commit, binary digests, and
target Cloud commit. It does not create a customer-promotable candidate.

Install both builds using the coordinates and content-addressed compatibility
evidence named in the workflow summary. Diagnostics must show
`COMPATIBILITY-LAB-NOT-FOR-PRODUCTION` and staging Cloud N+1. Apple documents that a [TestFlight
Internal Only build cannot be submitted to
customers](https://developer.apple.com/help/app-store-connect/test-a-beta-version/add-internal-testers/).
Google documents that an [Internal App Sharing artifact cannot be included in a
testing or production
release](https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/9844679).

On both iOS and Android record device/OS, glasses/firmware, exact app version and
build, tester, Cloud diagnostics, and timestamps. Verify:

- sign-in and session restoration;
- glasses pair/reconnect;
- Core and Runtime connection;
- a short privacy-safe transcription;
- one representative photo/media/Bluetooth path;
- restart/reconnect; and
- no production endpoint in diagnostics or captured traffic.

Copy `evidence/staging-mobile-n.template.json`, fill it, store screenshots/logs
at durable credential-free HTTPS URLs, then run:

```bash
./scripts/production-release.mjs attest --release X.Y.Z \
  --check staging-mobile-n-compatibility \
  --evidence release-evidence/X.Y.Z/staging-mobile-n.json
```

Every `appVersion` and `appBuild` must exactly match the frozen coordinates
shown by `status`; placeholders and coordinates from another build are
rejected.

Any failure requires a fixed beta identity. Do not carry evidence across source
changes.

## Phases 3 and 4 - production config and Cloud V2

Run `next` once for preflight and, after it succeeds, again for deployment:

```bash
./scripts/production-release.mjs next --release X.Y.Z
```

Preflight loads staging and production configuration into temporary mode-0600
files, validates the versioned contract, and publishes only key names and
pass/fail results. It never compares or publishes raw values or secret hashes.
Some requirements are conditional (`requiredWhen` in the contract): the
runtime's storage-event webhook secret and its R2/S3 credentials apply only
while `STORAGE_PROVIDER` is `r2` or `s3`. Production runs the `local` provider
for managed photos (the cloud photo path is being retired), so those checks
report `inactive` rather than failing; keys that are present anyway are still
validated.

Before approving `production-cloud`, compare the frozen source, target, previous
revision, migration notes, and rollback coordinates in the workflow summary.
The deploy records the observed Cloud V2 deployment result, not merely the
request. GitHub's protected-environment history records the approval; after the
approved job succeeds, the promotion advances once from
`production-config-ready` to `cloud-deployed`. Stop if readiness, running
revision, digest, or migration evidence is missing.

## Phase 5 - actual Mobile N against production Cloud N+1

Remove lab builds. Install or update the Mentra App through the public App Store
and Google Play and verify the displayed coordinates match the frozen current
production record. On both platforms repeat sign-in/session restore,
pair/reconnect, Core/Runtime, short transcription, representative media/BLE,
release-specific backward compatibility, and restart.

Use `evidence/production-mobile-n.template.json` and attest:

```bash
./scripts/production-release.mjs attest --release X.Y.Z \
  --check production-mobile-n-compatibility \
  --evidence release-evidence/X.Y.Z/production-mobile-n.json
```

If either platform fails, stop. Choose an explicit Cloud rollback or forward
fix, then repeat all invalidated evidence.

To submit for store review before this verification is done, defer the gate
and attest it during review:

```bash
./scripts/production-release.mjs defer --release X.Y.Z \
  --check production-mobile-n-compatibility --reason "verify during store review"
```

## Phases 6 through 8 - build, upload, and accept candidates

Run:

```bash
./scripts/production-release.mjs next --release X.Y.Z
```

After `production-mobile-candidates` approval, the workflow rebuilds the two
Mentra App candidates. They target production Cloud and use the frozen OTA pin.
Outputs go only to:

- TestFlight `Mentra Production Candidates`;
- the Mentra App Play internal-testing track.

They are normal customer-eligible candidates, never TestFlight Internal Only or
Internal App Sharing artifacts. A retry reuses only an exact matching coordinate
and immutable artifact. GitHub candidate archives are stored in this promotion
attempt's private draft container, not in `mentra-vX.Y.Z`; a replacement attempt
therefore cannot inherit an earlier attempt's archives.

Install through TestFlight and Play, not local archives. On iOS and Android test
the Mentra App clean install/upgrade, production auth/session, pair/reconnect,
Core/Runtime, transcription, media/BLE, OTA identity, permissions/background,
telemetry environment, no staging endpoints, and every release-specific config
check.

Use `evidence/production-candidates.template.json` and attest:

```bash
./scripts/production-release.mjs attest --release X.Y.Z \
  --check production-mobile-candidate-acceptance \
  --evidence release-evidence/X.Y.Z/production-candidates.json
```

A binary/configuration failure needs a new build number and new candidate
acceptance. Abort this attempt rather than relabeling a failed build.

## Phases 9 and 10 - submit and wait for review

In both consoles first complete all human-only metadata and verify exact build
numbers. For Apple select manual release; use phased release for normal Mentra
App updates unless the approver documents an exception. For Play verify managed
publishing before an existing-app production submission.

Then run `next`. The protected workflow submits the exact iOS build with manual
release and verifies that the exact Android version code is held on the Google
production track: the draft the candidate build uploaded in Phase 7, or that
release already rolled out in the Console and kept unpublished by managed
publishing (the API never sends Play changes for review on its own). A rerun
after a later failure reconciles an iOS version already in review instead of
submitting it again. If a store field blocks the
API, finish only the equivalent UI action and rerun; the workflow must read
back the same build.

Apple UI fallback:

1. App Store Connect -> app -> target iOS version.
2. Select the exact accepted build.
3. Choose manual release and phased release as applicable.
4. Add for Review, open the draft submission, verify the build again, and
   Submit for Review.

Google, always in the Console (this step has no API path):

1. Play Console -> app -> Production -> the draft release that names the exact
   candidate version code (do not create another release).
2. Complete release notes/declarations, Review release, then Send for review.
3. For existing apps, confirm the change remains in managed publishing.

Check without holding a runner:

```bash
./scripts/production-release.mjs status --release X.Y.Z --refresh
```

Record rejection messages and responses. Metadata-only corrections may reuse
the exact binary. Any binary/config change requires a new candidate and full
candidate acceptance.

When Apple and Google show review complete for both exact coordinates, fill
`evidence/store-review-approved.template.json` and run:

```bash
./scripts/production-release.mjs attest --release X.Y.Z \
  --check store-review-approved \
  --evidence release-evidence/X.Y.Z/store-review-approved.json
```

## Phases 11 and 12 - public release and rollout

Every deferred human gate must be attested first; `release` refuses otherwise,
and so does the promotion chain itself. Then request the protected two-person
release approval:

```bash
./scripts/production-release.mjs release --release X.Y.Z
```

This first appends approval only. It does not pretend that a GitHub approval
clicked a store button. After approval, perform the exact UI actions:

- Apple: release the exact approved version; leave Mentra App phased release
  enabled unless an exception was approved.
- Google: Publishing overview -> Publish changes, then start the
  approved staged rollout for the exact version code.

The verification workflow requires the exact Google version code to be in a
production release whose status is `inProgress` with a nonzero rollout fraction
or `completed`. A draft, halted release, or bare production-track membership
does not advance the promotion.

Run `next` to verify the exact builds are publicly rolling out and enter
`rolling-out`.

Use dashboards, crash-free sessions, auth/session, Core/Runtime connection,
transcription, Bluetooth/media, support reports, Cloud saturation/error rate,
and store install telemetry. Halt rollout on unexplained regression. Prefer
halting mobile and forward-fixing Cloud after any Mobile N+1 reaches users;
Cloud rollback is safe only when the affected N+1-to-N pairing was separately
proven.

After changing Google rollout percentage in Play Console and verifying Apple
phased-release state, record monotonically increasing observations:

```bash
./scripts/production-release.mjs advance --release X.Y.Z --android-percent 25
./scripts/production-release.mjs advance --release X.Y.Z --android-percent 50
./scripts/production-release.mjs advance --release X.Y.Z --complete
```

`--complete` first records 100 percent and enters the durable `finalizing`
checkpoint. It then stages `mentra-release-plan-X.Y.Z.json` and
`mentra-release-X.Y.Z.json`, plus the exact finalizing checkpoint record, in the
draft `mentra-vX.Y.Z` release and only then closes the immutable promotion
chain. If finalization is interrupted, rerun the same `--complete` command; it
verifies identical existing assets and resumes. Do not abort or start a
replacement attempt after `finalizing`: the 100 percent rollout is already
public, so the only valid recovery is to finish reconciling this attempt.
Do not complete until both Mentra App store pages are publicly reachable in
intended territories, install/update returns the exact coordinates, production
Cloud is healthy, and the release owner has recorded the final observation
window.

After completion, inspect the two canonical assets and perform the final public
availability checks. Publish the already-staged GitHub release manually; no
workflow in this system publishes it automatically.

## Stable packages - independent of the mobile path

The plain `X.Y.Z` package versions (npm `latest`, the stable Maven Central
coordinates, and the SwiftPM tag) are published by
`production-release-packages.yml`. This is a separate step from the Cloud
deployment and the Mentra App promotion. It is keyed on the promoted beta, not
on a promotion state, so it can run at any point after `promote` has merged the
beta source into `main`: before the promotion is prepared, while store review
is pending, or after rollout. No mobile phase waits on it and it never
transitions the promotion state machine.

Both phases build from the exact `sourceCommit` recorded in the selected
beta's `release-plan.json`, verified to be contained in `main`, and reuse the
beta's frozen OTA manifest pin. The release identity is the beta's base
version (`3.1.0-beta.192` publishes `3.1.0`).

Phase 1 stages everything without moving any default pointer:

```bash
./scripts/production-release.mjs packages --beta X.Y.Z-beta.N --phase publish
```

After `production-packages` approval it runs the same reusable npm and native
SDK jobs as the coordinated beta on the production channel:

- npm publishes every family member at `X.Y.Z` under the dist-tag
  `candidate-X.Y.Z`; `latest` is untouched. Publication uses provenance, so if
  npm trusted publishing is scoped per workflow file, register
  `production-release-packages.yml` for each package or keep `NPM_TOKEN` set.
- Maven Central receives a `USER_MANAGED` Sonatype deployment. The phase only
  succeeds once Sonatype reports it validated; nothing is public until phase 2.
- The SwiftPM export is committed and pushed to the mirror branch
  `release/X.Y.Z` of `mentra-bluetooth-sdk-ios`; no tag is created.

Phase 2 makes them public after `production-packages-release` approval:

```bash
./scripts/production-release.mjs packages --beta X.Y.Z-beta.N --phase release
```

It first checks all three targets without changing anything: every npm
member is published and its `latest` is not already newer, the Sonatype
deployment is validated, and the staged SwiftPM commit is the one recorded in
the archived export. Only then does it move npm `latest` to `X.Y.Z` for every
member (the candidate dist-tag stays as a record; npm refuses to delete tags
with the automation token), request the Sonatype publication and
wait for `PUBLISHED`, and push the SwiftPM tag `X.Y.Z`. Moving a dist-tag
requires the `NPM_TOKEN` automation secret; trusted-publisher OIDC only covers
`npm publish`.

Both phases are idempotent: a rerun reuses versions, deployments, and mirror
commits that already exist and refuses anything that exists with different
bytes. Evidence is stored as content-addressed assets in the stable release
`mentra-vX.Y.Z` (the same draft the rollout finalization stages the canonical
records into; it is also accepted after that release has been published by
hand). The promotion chain is never written by these phases, so they cannot
race a Cloud or mobile transition. It is read once: a live attempt for `X.Y.Z`
that froze a different beta or source is a hard stop, and an allocated attempt
without a state record must be resumed or aborted first.

Stop conditions specific to packages:

- Once phase 1 has published `X.Y.Z` on npm, that identity is spent. An aborted
  promotion cannot be replaced by a different source under the same version;
  bump the family base version on `dev` and cut a new beta.
- Do not run phase 2 until the Cloud side of the release is at least deployed
  or you have explicitly decided that the stable packages may lead it.

## Bluetooth example - production candidates

The production Bluetooth example is built by `production-release-example.yml`
after the stable packages are public. Like the packages it is keyed on the
promoted beta, never on a promotion attempt, and it never transitions the
promotion state machine.

```bash
./scripts/production-release.mjs example --beta X.Y.Z-beta.N
```

It refuses to start until `@mentra/bluetooth-sdk@X.Y.Z` and `@mentra/engine@X.Y.Z`
are public on npm, because the Starter Kit installs them from the registry.
Then it:

- freezes a production example plan from the beta's exact `sourceCommit` and
  frozen OTA manifest pin, with one example build number allocated above both
  store inventories and the beta's own number;
- requests the Starter Kit's production channel, which synchronizes its `main`
  branch to the plain versions, builds the examples, tags `sdk-X.Y.Z`, and
  publishes them in the non-prerelease Starter Kit release `sdk-X.Y.Z`
  (including `mentra-example-react-native-X.Y.Z.apk`);
- uploads the iOS build to the external TestFlight group
  `Mentra Bluetooth Example` (created with its public link on first use) and
  submits it for Beta App Review, and uploads the Android build to the closed
  Play track `Mentra Bluetooth Example Production Candidates`. Create that
  track once in Play Console under exactly that name; a Play track serves one
  release at a time, so the production example never shares the internal or
  open-testing tracks with the dev and beta examples; and
- records `mentra-example-release-X.Y.Z.json` in the stable release
  `mentra-vX.Y.Z`, the same draft the packages and the rollout finalization
  stage records into. The record carries `storePromotion: "never"`.

A rerun reuses the Starter Kit release, TestFlight build, and Play upload that
already exist and refuses anything that exists with different bytes. A Play
upload that fails leaves the Starter Kit release and TestFlight build in place
and stops the record; rerun once Play accepts the build. The record is written
as soon as Apple has the build for review; the public link becomes installable
when Beta App Review approves it.

## Abort, retry, and incident handling

Abort an attempt with:

```bash
./scripts/production-release.mjs abort --release X.Y.Z --reason "concise reason"
```

Abort is terminal and does not itself roll Cloud back or remove store builds.
Follow the incident commander's explicit mitigation. A new attempt allocates
new store build numbers and references the failed attempt. Never delete failed
evidence. The workflow refuses to allocate another attempt until every prior
attempt for that release identity is aborted, and it never permits abort after
the 100 percent `finalizing` checkpoint. Preparation runs are serialized while
they allocate attempts, so starting two beta selections does not create two
active promotions. A retry resumes a zero-state container only when its selected
beta, source commit, prior-production provenance, store inventories, release
family, and Mentra App coordinates match exactly through one deterministic
digest.

Common stop conditions include source/lock mismatch, missing store provenance,
unclassified Cloud config, non-backward-compatible migration, Mobile N failure,
wrong endpoint or OTA pin, store coordinate drift, rejected binary, missing
reviewer access, and monitoring uncertainty during rollout.

## Store rejection: resubmit with a corrected beta

When App Review or Google Play rejects a candidate, the correction lands on
`staging` like any other change and its coordinated run cuts a new beta of the
same release identity. The promotion has no "rejected" state; a new attempt
carries the corrected beta. One command does the whole walk, from a clean,
up-to-date `staging` checkout:

```bash
./scripts/production-release.mjs resubmit --release X.Y.Z --beta X.Y.Z-beta.N --reason "what the store rejected and what changed"
```

It aborts the current attempt (recording the reason), promotes the beta into
`main` (`--merge-admin` merges the exact head with administrator rights when
the gate cannot complete), starts the next attempt, then dispatches each
workflow in turn and waits for it: Cloud preflight, Cloud deploy, the
candidate builds. If the rejected attempt had deferred
`production-mobile-n-compatibility`, the deferral is carried over with a
reason that names the earlier attempt; a gate the earlier attempt attested
itself is not copied. It stops once the new candidates are uploaded, because
candidate acceptance is the verification of the correction: install the exact
builds, then `attest` (or `defer`) `production-mobile-candidate-acceptance` and
run `next` to submit. Interrupted? Run the same command again; every step is
decided from the latest promotion records, including a container that
preparation allocated without a state record yet. Each dispatch carries a
fresh id that the workflow shows in its run name, so the command waits on
exactly the run it started, whatever else is running.

On App Store Connect the rejected build stays attached to the version until the
submission replaces it; nothing needs detaching by hand. On Google Play the new
candidate arrives as a fresh draft on the production track and replaces the
held one.

## UI-only GitHub fallback

If the local CLI is unavailable, open Actions, select the workflow named by the
current state, click Run workflow, keep branch `main`, and copy release identity
and attempt exactly from the promotion container. Never select a feature branch.
Human evidence must first be uploaded with the immutable naming convention; the
recommended recovery is to restore the CLI rather than improvising API calls.

## Validation boundary

Changes to these workflows are validated by pull-request tests and tabletop
records. A PR must never dispatch a production workflow. The first end-to-end
external validation necessarily occurs during an explicitly authorized release,
with every protected approval and stop condition above still in force.
