# Mentra Private Deployment Azure reference

This directory is Mentra's non-production, customer-shaped reference stack. The
cloud-neutral image and configuration contract is in
[private-deployment.md](../../private-deployment.md). The Azure template starts the
same immutable Mentra Cloud image as two Container Apps:

- customer Core with Cosmos DB for MongoDB-compatible persistence and Azure Files for durable report attachments; and
- meetings-only Runtime with the `acs-teams` provider.

It also creates ACS, a Container Apps environment, pull identity, managed TLS
for the workspace hostname, and the served deployment manifest. The Runtime
profile does not start Redis, UDP, cloud audio, camera, Cloudflare, speech,
maps, Store, or reporting dependencies.

Core's report API is available independently of Runtime and consumer telemetry.
See [report setup and retrieval](operations.md#reports-and-durable-attachments)
for existing admin org API-key authorization and the attachment-storage lifecycle.

The Enterprise Demo manifest enables the built-in Give Feedback miniapp alongside
Settings. Reports go to the selected Enterprise Core, including phone logs and
screenshots for bug reports. The confirmation provides a copyable report ID.
Re-select the workspace to refresh a previously cached manifest; Settings → Give
Feedback also opens the same form.

## Reference identities

- Tenant: `2e7662c0-e826-4928-95b2-60bdd48d5d95`
- Mobile public client: `95ad08c2-7837-4ddf-933c-1fce3d6d2799`
- Core API: `20424d9e-4b99-44e8-82c9-0ad06f08a8db`
- Core scope: `api://20424d9e-4b99-44e8-82c9-0ad06f08a8db/mentra.session`
- Workspace: `https://mentra.acmeworkspace.com`

The demo workspace is branded **Acme Industries**. The original
`https://enterprisedev.mentraglass.com` remains an HTTPS alias for existing
installs. Both addresses serve the same deployment, with discovery URLs matching
the address used to enroll. The deployment ID, Core origin, Entra tenant, and existing sessions
are preserved. `acmeworkspace.com` is also verified as an Entra sign-in domain;
demo employee accounts still require their own assignment and Teams license.

The Mobile enterprise application is assignment-required. Its public-client
redirects cover iOS, the Mentra-signed Android APK, and Google Play signing.
The current assigned pilot users are managed in Entra, not in Mentra.

Use:

- [deployment-manifest-reference.md](../../deployment-manifest-reference.md) for every manifest field and a complete customer example;
- [entra-setup.md](./entra-setup.md) for identity setup;
- [customer-setup.md](./customer-setup.md) for delivery and qualification; and
- [operations.md](./operations.md) for image import, upgrades, and rollback.

The idempotent Entra helper creates or reconciles the Core API and Mobile app:

```bash
cloud-v2/deploy/azure/enterprise-reference/scripts/configure-entra.sh \
  --core-name "ACME Mentra Core" \
  --mobile-name "ACME Mentra Mobile"
```

## Coordinated reference deployment

The `dev` coordinated release:

1. builds `ghcr.io/mentra-community/mentra-cloud` from the exact release commit;
2. signs build provenance and an SPDX SBOM;
3. imports that digest into the reference ACR;
4. deploys Core and Runtime from the same imported digest;
5. verifies Core health/readiness/JWKS and Runtime health/readiness/version/
   manifest/legal/branding/auth boundaries; and
6. records both revisions and the immutable digest in release evidence.

Mentra Cloud's existing deployment job is unchanged. The reference stack has no
independent push trigger, so it cannot drift from the coordinated `dev` release.

On the first successful publication only, a Mentra organization owner must set
the `mentra-cloud` package visibility to **Public** in GitHub package settings.
The reference deployment can consume the package using its workflow token
before that change, but customer registries cannot import it anonymously until
the one-time visibility setting is applied.

Persistent signing keys and the refresh pepper live as GitHub Actions secrets
for this Mentra-owned reference environment and become Container App secrets.
Customer deployments use their own approved secret manager.

## Customer-shaped deployment

The supported assisted path takes one public configuration file and one
mode-0600 secret file. Copy and edit the example, then generate the durable
signing material before deploying:

```bash
cp cloud-v2/deploy/azure/enterprise-reference/deployment.config.example.json \
  /secure/path/mentra-private.config.json
cloud-v2/deploy/azure/enterprise-reference/scripts/generate-private-secrets.sh \
  /secure/path/mentra-private-secrets.json
cloud-v2/deploy/azure/enterprise-reference/scripts/deploy.sh --validate-only \
  /secure/path/mentra-private.config.json \
  /secure/path/mentra-private-secrets.json
cloud-v2/deploy/azure/enterprise-reference/scripts/deploy.sh \
  /secure/path/mentra-private.config.json \
  /secure/path/mentra-private-secrets.json
```

The helper creates the resource group, bootstraps ACR, imports and verifies the
digest, deploys Core and Runtime through a protected temporary parameter file,
removes that file, runs the smoke test, and prints the deployment outputs.
Import the durable secret file into approved secret management; replacing its
values is a deliberate session/key rotation, not an ordinary redeploy.

### Teams meeting creation

After completing [Graph consent and Teams access policy](./entra-setup.md#meeting-creation),
set `teamsGraphClientId` and `teamsGraphOrganizerId` in the public deployment
configuration and add `teamsGraphClientSecret` to the protected secret file.
`teamsGraphTenantId` defaults to `tenantId`. Leaving these inputs empty preserves
join-only server behavior; creation returns a configuration error.

The reference CI deployment reads GitHub variables
`ENTERPRISE_DEV_TEAMS_GRAPH_CLIENT_ID` and `ENTERPRISE_DEV_TEAMS_GRAPH_ORGANIZER_ID`,
and secret `ENTERPRISE_DEV_TEAMS_GRAPH_CLIENT_SECRET`. Its Graph tenant is the
configured Entra tenant. Bicep stores the secret only on Runtime; neither Core
nor the deployment manifest receives it.

### Custom hostname

For a custom hostname, first deploy without `workspaceHostname`, create a
DNS-only CNAME to the printed `generatedRuntimeHostname`, and create
`asuid.<workspace-hostname>` as a TXT record whose value is the printed
`customDomainVerificationId`. Then set `workspaceHostname` and rerun the same
helper. The Core reference uses its Azure-generated TLS hostname and is declared
separately in `services.coreUrl`.

When migrating an existing hostname, set `workspaceCertificateName` to a new
managed-certificate resource name; Azure certificates cannot change their subject
in place. To keep existing clients working, include the old binding in
`additionalWorkspaceDomains`, for example:

```json
{
  "workspaceHostname": "mentra.acmeworkspace.com",
  "workspaceCertificateName": "ca-mentra-enterprise-reference-acme-workspace",
  "additionalWorkspaceDomains": [
    {
      "hostname": "enterprisedev.mentraglass.com",
      "certificateName": "ca-mentra-enterprise-reference-workspace"
    }
  ]
}
```

Additional certificates must already exist in the same Container Apps
environment. Preserve their DNS records, and serve the old hostname directly
rather than redirecting API requests. Bicep also configures Runtime's
`DEPLOYMENT_WORKSPACE_ALIASES` as a JSON array of the retained HTTPS origins.
For those explicit hosts, Runtime serves a discovery manifest with Runtime,
branding, and managed-bundle URLs on the requesting origin. Core, Entra identity,
miniapp configuration, bundle versions and hashes remain unchanged. Arbitrary
hosts and forwarded-host headers cannot introduce another manifest origin.
These settings are also accepted by `scripts/deploy.sh`. Upgrade Runtime to a
version supporting the alias setting before changing the canonical manifest.

This procedure supports subdomains only (for example `mentra.acme.example`).
An apex domain cannot carry a CNAME; Azure requires an A record to the
environment's static inbound IP plus TXT or HTTP domain-control validation,
which `main.bicep` (hard-wired to CNAME validation) does not configure. Use a
subdomain, or extend the template before qualifying an apex hostname.

Cosmos DB keeps `publicNetworkAccess: Enabled` in this reference. Core reaches
it over the authenticated public endpoint because the Container Apps
environment has no VNet; disabling public access requires a VNet-integrated
environment and a Cosmos private endpoint, and the Container Apps outbound IPs
are not known before Core exists, so an IP firewall cannot be templated here.
Treat this as a documented tradeoff, not a production network posture; see
[customer-setup.md](./customer-setup.md) for the private-networking guidance.

## Smoke test

```bash
export MENTRA_WORKSPACE=https://mentra.acmeworkspace.com
cloud-v2/deploy/azure/enterprise-reference/scripts/smoke-test.sh "$MENTRA_WORKSPACE"
```

Then enroll the official Mentra App through **Connect to organization**, sign in
as an assigned employee, verify relaunch/refresh/logout/workspace switching, and
check that no Mentra consumer telemetry or services are contacted. Microsoft,
ACS, the customer workspace, and customer Core remain expected egress.

This qualifies private infrastructure and restricted networking; it is not a
literal zero-internet air-gapped profile.

## Mentra Call

The reference manifest pins Mentra Call 2.1.40. Its ZIP is included in the Runtime
image under `miniapps/` and is byte-identical to the Mentra App's bundled ZIP.
The coordinated deployment passes that managed list to Bicep and verifies the
served bundle's SHA-256. Updating Call requires updating both copies and the pin.

Use the matching Mentra App native build from this change, then re-select the
workspace to refresh an already cached deployment manifest. Call uses the selected
Runtime for credentials and a direct glasses link for media. It prefers the Entra
Teams identity and automatically uses guest mode for an absent identity or a
confirmed missing Teams license; the call screen reports the selected mode.
Existing installed consumer clients continue using the existing Call backend routes.
The new Call bundle requires host meeting-policy discovery; hosts lacking that API
show an update message and cannot send requests to a public Call backend.

Before releasing, qualify licensed and unlicensed joins on both Android and iOS,
including lobby admission, remote identity, two-way audio/video and cancellation.
