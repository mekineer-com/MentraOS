# Mentra Private Deployment contract

This is the cloud-neutral operator contract for a Mentra Private Deployment.
The customer runs Core and Runtime as separate services from one immutable,
public OCI image. Platform templates configure these processes; they do not
require a customer-specific fork or APK.

```text
ghcr.io/mentra-community/mentra-cloud:<release-identity>
ghcr.io/mentra-community/mentra-cloud:<source-commit>
ghcr.io/mentra-community/mentra-cloud@sha256:<digest>
```

Deploy the digest form. Tags are discovery aids. The current image targets
`linux/amd64`, has no default command, and is started twice:

| Service | Command |
| --- | --- |
| Core | `bun packages/core/src/index.ts` |
| Runtime | `bun packages/runtime/src/index.ts` |

Core owns persistent users, refresh sessions, signing keys, Runtime-token
minting, and miniapp-token minting. Runtime owns device/media capabilities and
receives only Core's public verification material. Do not give Runtime Core's
private keys or database credentials.

## Configuration boundaries

| Class | Examples | Storage |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Service configuration | URLs, module selectors, issuer metadata, ports, version floors | Container environment |
| Secrets | Mongo credentials, refresh pepper, signing private keys, ACS connection string | Secret manager/container secret references |
| Mentra App policy | Workspace name, service URLs, auth, branding, legal links, miniapps, glasses, features, telemetry | Deployment manifest served by Runtime |

Never put secrets in the image, deployment manifest, command line, or source
repository.

## Core configuration

| Variable | Kind | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `PORT` | Public | HTTP port; defaults to `3000`. |
| `MONGO_URL` | Secret | Persistent Mongo-compatible database URI. |
| `REFRESH_TOKEN_PEPPER` | Secret | Stable high-entropy refresh-token hashing key. |
| `MENTRA_JWT_PRIVATE_KEY` | Secret | Ed25519 PKCS#8 body for access and Runtime tokens. |
| `MENTRA_JWT_PUBLIC_KEY` | Public verification material | Matching Ed25519 SPKI body. |
| `MENTRA_MINIAPP_JWT_PRIVATE_KEY` | Secret | Separate Ed25519 PKCS#8 body for miniapp tokens. |
| `MENTRA_MINIAPP_JWT_PUBLIC_KEY` | Public verification material | Matching Ed25519 SPKI body. |
| `CLOUD_CORE_ISSUER` | Public | Deployment-unique HTTPS Core origin. |
| `CLOUD_CORE_OIDC_PROVIDERS` | Public | Explicitly trusted workforce OIDC providers as JSON. |

Signing keys and the refresh pepper must survive upgrades. An Entra provider is
configured explicitly:

```json
[
  {
    "id": "workforce",
    "protocol": "oidc",
    "providerKind": "microsoft-entra",
    "tenantId": "acme-private",
    "issuer": "https://login.microsoftonline.com/<tenant-id>/v2.0",
    "jwksUrl": "https://login.microsoftonline.com/<tenant-id>/discovery/v2.0/keys",
    "audience": "<core-api-client-id>",
    "subjectClaim": "oid",
    "directoryTenantClaim": "tid",
    "expectedDirectoryTenantId": "<tenant-id>",
    "requiredScopes": ["mentra.session"],
    "allowedClientIds": ["<mobile-client-id>"]
  }
]
```

Core issues an opaque Mentra user id. It retains provider metadata only for host
integrations such as proving an ACS token belongs to the same Entra employee.
Miniapp tokens never contain the federated identity.

## Runtime modules

`RUNTIME_SERVICES` is a comma-separated positive allowlist. Unknown names fail
startup. When absent, blank, or `full`, Runtime retains the legacy Mentra Cloud
profile: `realtime-audio,camera,maps,tts`; it does not implicitly add meetings.

| Value | Surface/dependencies |
| --- | --- |
| `realtime-audio` | WebSocket, UDP ingest, Redis ownership/workers, transcription. |
| `camera` | Photo and managed-stream routes; currently requires `realtime-audio`. |
| `maps` | Directions, geocoding, and places. |
| `tts` | Speech synthesis. |
| `meetings` | Native meeting credentials and Teams meeting creation/retirement. |

The first call-focused profile is:

```text
RUNTIME_SERVICES=meetings
MEETING_PROVIDERS=acs-teams
```

It always needs secret `ACS_CONNECTION_STRING`. Public `ENTRA_TENANT_ID` and
`ENTRA_CLIENT_ID` are additionally required to exchange a delegated Microsoft
token and join as an employee; without a delegated token the authenticated user
receives a guest credential from the same ACS resource. It does not need Redis,
UDP, Cloudflare, Soniox, ElevenLabs, Mapbox, or object storage. Runtime trusts
only Core-issued tokens:

```text
CLOUD_RUNTIME_AUTH_AUDIENCE=cloud-runtime
CLOUD_RUNTIME_AUTH_ISSUERS=[{"issuer":"https://core.workspace.example","jwksUrl":"https://core.workspace.example/.well-known/jwks.json","userIdClaim":"sub","tenantIdClaim":"tenant_id","algorithms":["EdDSA"]}]
```

The authenticated credential endpoint is `POST /api/meetings/acs/token`. An
empty request issues or reuses an anonymous ACS guest credential. A request with
`{"teamsUserAadToken":"..."}` verifies that delegated token against the
Core-signed federated identity and exchanges it for an employee credential. The
response reports `identityMode` as `guest` or `teams-user`. A supplied invalid
token is rejected and never falls back to guest issuance.
If Microsoft rejects a verified employee specifically with
`UserLicenseNotPresentForbidden`, Runtime issues a guest credential and reports
`guestReason: "teams-license-unavailable"`. Other authorization, consent, network,
and provider errors do not trigger guest issuance.

The Mentra App obtains credentials using its selected Runtime and Core-brokered
Runtime bearer. Its Entra provider supplies the separate Teams subject token when
available. `session.meeting.getConfiguration()` exposes the host's calling policy;
workspace miniapps omit `token` from `session.meeting.join()`. Meeting state and
`onState` report `identityMode` (`guest` or `teams-user`) and, for guests,
`guestReason` (`no-entra-identity` or `teams-license-unavailable`). Neither the Entra
nor ACS credential is returned to miniapp JavaScript.

Workspace Mentra Call supports joining work/school Teams links using direct
local glasses video. It does not contact the public Call backend for startup,
restore, credentials, or meeting creation. Existing consumer token pass-through
and Call backend routes remain supported; consumer joins still require the
miniapp-supplied credential. Older clients need no backend change.
A Mentra App native build containing Teams-user agent support is required for
employee identity. Install the matching managed miniapp ZIP and re-select the
workspace to refresh the cached manifest. The new Call bundle requires host
meeting-policy discovery even when the host version is otherwise compatible.
Hosts without that API show an update message and cannot enable public-backend
access. Existing installed Call bundles and legacy token joins are unchanged.


Guest identity reuse and abuse throttling are bounded in-process state. The v1
reference therefore runs one Runtime replica. Before scaling the meetings
profile horizontally, provide a shared atomic identity/rate-limit store or an
equivalent ingress control; otherwise separate replicas can issue separate ACS
guest identities for the same authenticated user.

Provider enablement is explicit, never inferred from whether an API key exists.

### Teams meeting creation

`POST /api/meetings/teams/create` accepts `subject` (1–120 characters, default
`Mentra Call`), `durationMinutes` (1–1440, default 30), and an optional host-owned
`teamsUserAadToken`. It uses the same Core authentication and employee binding
as the credential endpoint. The caller cannot supply an organizer ID.

Runtime requires `TEAMS_GRAPH_TENANT_ID`, `TEAMS_GRAPH_CLIENT_ID`, and secret
`TEAMS_GRAPH_CLIENT_SECRET`. `TEAMS_GRAPH_ORGANIZER_ID` is the licensed organizer
object ID for callers without an eligible Teams identity. The Graph application
needs admin-consented **application** permission `OnlineMeetings.ReadWrite.All`
and a Teams application access policy for each permitted employee organizer
and the fallback organizer. See [Entra setup](./azure/enterprise-reference/entra-setup.md#meeting-creation).

For a verified Entra caller, Runtime checks eligibility through the existing ACS
Teams-user exchange and creates as that employee. Only Microsoft's explicit
`UserLicenseNotPresentForbidden` result uses the fallback organizer. Callers
without an Entra token also use that organizer. Identity, consent, Graph policy,
and network errors propagate; they do not change the organizer. A Microsoft 365
subscription name alone does not establish Teams eligibility.

`session.meeting.create({provider: "acs-teams", subject, durationMinutes})`
returns `provider`, `joinUrl`, an opaque `meetingRef`, `identityMode`, and a guest
reason when applicable. The host obtains the identity token; credentials stay
out of miniapp JavaScript. `getConfiguration().creationSource === "runtime"`
advertises host support; missing server configuration returns an actionable
error. Older private hosts keep joining available and hide New Call. Consumer
Call keeps its existing backend creation flow. Creating with the fallback
organizer does not grant organizer identity to a guest participant.

`session.meeting.retire(meetingRef)` calls `POST /api/meetings/teams/retire`.
The signed ownership reference permits only the original Core tenant/user to
delete that meeting in the original Graph application. It expires 24 hours
after the scheduled end, and Graph client-secret rotation invalidates existing
references. No Runtime database is required. Retiring a Graph resource does not
hang up active participants; native meeting termination is a separate action.

Creation is limited to 12 attempts per caller per 10 minutes per Runtime
process. Use shared rate limiting before scaling beyond one replica. Creation
POSTs are not automatically retried: a provider timeout can leave a meeting
created without a confirmed response.

## Deployment manifest

Use the [complete manifest reference](./deployment-manifest-reference.md) for
every field, required values and defaults, URL restrictions, working examples,
and the current enrollment and refresh behavior.

Runtime accepts exactly one of `DEPLOYMENT_MANIFEST_JSON` or an absolute
`DEPLOYMENT_MANIFEST_PATH`. Setting both fails startup. Runtime limits the JSON
to 256 KiB, validates feature/module consistency, and serves it with `no-store`:

```text
GET /.well-known/mentra-deployment.json
```

Important schema-v1 fields are:

| Field | Contract |
| --- | --- |
| `deploymentId`, `displayName` | Stable local namespace and workspace name. |
| `services.coreUrl`, `services.runtimeUrl` | Required by the first template. Null never falls back to Mentra services. |
| `auth` | Exact Entra tenant, Mentra App public-client id, `mentra.session` scope, optional Teams scopes. |
| `branding.logoUrls` | Optional light/dark PNGs. |
| `systemMiniapps.approvedPackageNamesOverride` | Allowlist for SYSTEM miniapps embedded in the Mentra App. |
| `miniapps.managed` | Userland bundle package, version, URL, and SHA-256 descriptors. |
| `miniapps.configuration` | Optional non-secret package-scoped string values. |
| `features` | Explicit mobile/Runtime capability policy. |
| `telemetry` | Whether the workspace permits Mentra telemetry. |

Most miniapps ignore `miniapps.configuration`. A miniapp that explicitly
supports a customer backend may read an optional `backendUrl` through
`session.configuration`; if absent it retains its compiled consumer default.

### Miniapp backend authentication

Core mints the same package-scoped miniapp tokens used by Mentra Cloud. A
backend dedicated to one Private Deployment verifies them locally with
`@mentra/auth` and must explicitly trust that deployment's Core:

```ts
const auth = createMentraAuth({
  packageName: "com.example.remoteassist",
  issuer: "https://core.workspace.example",
  jwksUrl: "https://core.workspace.example/.well-known/jwks.json",
})
```

Do not rely on `@mentra/auth`'s Mentra Cloud defaults in a customer backend,
and never accept an issuer or JWKS URL supplied by a client or token. A
backend shared by Mentra Cloud and multiple Private Deployments needs an
explicit issuer-to-JWKS trust list; that multi-Core helper is a later SDK
addition, not a reason to produce customer-specific miniapp bundles.

Runtime requires exact feature/module agreement in both directions:
`runtimeRealtimeSession` and `cloudSpeech` equal whether `realtime-audio` is
enabled, `managedStreams` equals `camera`, `nativeMeetings` equals `meetings`,
and `navigation` equals `maps`. `tts` alone does not satisfy `cloudSpeech` in
the current validator. `onDeviceSpeech` needs no Runtime module.

Optional same-origin assets use `DEPLOYMENT_PRIVACY_PATH`,
`DEPLOYMENT_TERMS_PATH`, `DEPLOYMENT_LOGO_LIGHT_PATH`,
`DEPLOYMENT_LOGO_DARK_PATH`, and `DEPLOYMENT_MANAGED_MINIAPP_DIR`.

## Cloud-neutral Compose example

This shows the process boundary. Put secrets in an uncommitted Compose secret
mechanism and terminate TLS in customer ingress. Mongo is authenticated and is
not host-exposed. Generate `secrets/mongo-password` as a URL-safe value, for
example with `openssl rand -hex 32`.

Mongo authentication applies only to a fresh volume: the `mongo` image creates
the `MONGO_INITDB_ROOT_USERNAME` user only while initializing an empty
`/data/db`. An existing `mongo-data` volume that was provisioned without these
settings (an earlier unauthenticated configuration, a beta, or a manual
bootstrap) never gains the `mentra` user, and Core's `?authSource=admin` URI
then fails to authenticate at startup. Migrate such a volume once, before
switching Core to the authenticated URI, by creating the user in the running
unauthenticated instance:

```bash
docker compose exec mongo mongosh admin --eval \
  'db.createUser({user: "mentra", pwd: passwordPrompt(), roles: [{role: "root", db: "admin"}]})'
```

Alternatively back up, remove, and re-initialize the volume so the image
creates the user itself. Either path is a one-time operation.

```yaml
services:
  mongo:
    image: mongo:7
    restart: unless-stopped
    environment:
      MONGO_INITDB_ROOT_USERNAME: mentra
      MONGO_INITDB_ROOT_PASSWORD_FILE: /run/secrets/mongo_password
    secrets: [mongo_password]
    volumes: ["mongo-data:/data/db"]

## Validation, upgrades, and rollback

```bash
curl --fail https://core.workspace.example/healthz | jq
curl --fail https://core.workspace.example/ready | jq
curl --fail https://core.workspace.example/.well-known/jwks.json | jq
curl --fail https://workspace.example/healthz | jq
curl --fail https://workspace.example/ready | jq
curl --fail https://workspace.example/api/client/min-version | jq
curl --fail https://workspace.example/.well-known/mentra-deployment.json | jq
```

Upgrade Core and Runtime to the same new digest while preserving Mongo, secrets,
and the manifest. Rollback restores both services to the previous digest; it
does not generate new keys or restore an older database snapshot.

Verify provenance and the SPDX SBOM before mirroring:

```bash
IMAGE=ghcr.io/mentra-community/mentra-cloud@sha256:<release-digest>
docker pull "$IMAGE"
gh attestation verify "oci://$IMAGE" --repo Mentra-Community/MentraOS
gh attestation verify "oci://$IMAGE" \
  --repo Mentra-Community/MentraOS \
  --predicate-type https://spdx.dev/Document/v2.3
```

The SBOM covers the complete image filesystem, not only enabled services. The
coordinated workflow binds SBOM/provenance to the digest. After the first
publication, a Mentra organization owner sets the `mentra-cloud` GHCR package
visibility to public once in GitHub's package settings; subsequent versions
retain that package visibility. Importing the digest into ACR, ECR, or another
OCI registry changes transport, not the approved source.

The repository-level identity integration test exercises the real Core and
Runtime HTTP servers against MongoDB:

```bash
RUN_PRIVATE_DEPLOYMENT_E2E=true \
MONGO_URL=mongodb://127.0.0.1:27017/mentra-private-e2e \
bun test tests/private-deployment-auth.integration.test.ts
```
