# Shared device request claims

This API reserves one immutable request across workers. It is not a queue,
hardware authorization, fixture lock or test result. Keep the registered worker's
trust/admission checks, local durable claim and app/fixture ownership. The server
does not authenticate GitHub requests or prove the caller's physical worker ID;
only the trusted fleet controller/launchers receive its capability.

Configure a separate random `TEST_RUN_CLAIM_TOKEN` of at least 32 characters and
send it as `Authorization: Bearer ...`. Missing/short configuration disables the
API (503). This token does not grant result ingestion or admin access. Keep it
out of PR jobs. The worker's private execution token below is a separate secret.

The types in `src/types/test-run-claim.types.ts` define the strict JSON contract.
IDs use the existing bounded test-run ID syntax; hashes/tokens are 64 lowercase
hex characters. Bodies are limited to 4 KiB. Responses are `Cache-Control: no-store`.

## Claim exactly once

Before sending, durably save the request identity, a new execution ID and a
cryptographically random 32-byte execution token on the selected worker. Do not
regenerate these for a retry or move them to another worker. `requestSha256` is
the SHA256 of the authenticated immutable request bytes under the fleet's agreed
canonical encoding; all workers must use the same encoding.

`POST /api/internal/test-run-claims`:

```json
{
  "requestId": "routine-123-1-4136-day1-ota",
  "requestSha256": "64-lowercase-hex-characters",
  "workerId": "lab-mini-1",
  "fixtureId": "fixture-1",
  "executionId": "fresh-durable-execution-id",
  "executionToken": "64-random-lowercase-hex-characters"
}
```

Only **201 plus `executionGranted: true`** grants this invocation its initial
execution. It follows a majority-acknowledged, journaled Mongo insert behind a
unique request ID index. The response contains `claim`: the five identity fields,
`state: "claimed"` and server `claimedAt`. Save the grant before installation or
device actions. No response contains the execution token or its stored digest.

- Exact replay returns 200, `executionGranted: false`, and the original claim.
  This does not authorize resuming or restarting, even for the original owner.
- Reusing the request ID with a changed hash, worker, fixture, execution ID or
  execution token returns 409. Ownership never changes.
- Timeout, disconnect, malformed response or 5xx is ambiguous. Start no device
  work and do not automatically retry the claim. The insert may have committed.
  Unknown server outcomes return 503 with `error: "claim_outcome_unknown"`.
- Other non-201 responses never grant execution. Validation/authentication
  failures (400/401/413, or unconfigured 503) do not enter the claim service.

`GET /api/internal/test-run-claims/:requestId` returns
`{executionGranted:false, claim}` or 404. A missing record is not an execution
grant and cannot prove an earlier in-flight write will never commit. Reading an
existing claim never reconstructs a lost grant. Reconcile an ambiguous invocation
using the saved ownership and local evidence; do not dispatch it to another Mac.

## Record settlement without releasing the request

`PUT /api/internal/test-run-claims/:requestId/state` requires the original private
execution token and one settlement:

```json
{"executionToken":"original-token","settlement":{"state":"terminal","resultRunId":"run-1"}}
```

or `{"executionToken":"original-token","settlement":{"state":"recovery-required","reason":"Claim acknowledgement was lost; no hardware started"}}`.

The first settlement atomically changes `claimed` to the supplied state and adds
server `settledAt`; it returns 200 with `executionGranted:false`. The exact same
settlement can be replayed to reconcile a lost acknowledgement without changing
its timestamp. A different settlement returns 409; a wrong execution token
returns 403. Both terminal states remain permanently reserved. There is no
transition back to claimed, recovery-clear, expiry, delete, reassignment or replay
endpoint. Unsettled claims are also reserved indefinitely. A crashed owner may
leave `claimed`; operationally treat that unresolved state as requiring recovery.

`terminal` means the trusted caller recorded a terminal lifecycle result, not that
the test passed or the fixture is ready. `resultRunId` is a reference, not an
assertion that uploads have completed. Recovery authorization and later result
generations remain in the existing local lifecycle/results systems; they do not
replace this original settlement or permit a fresh execution of the request.

## Persistence and validation

Mongo `test_run_claims` is separate from `test_runs`: results intentionally allow
several run IDs per request for recovery. Core startup awaits the unique claim
index before serving. Claim writes use majority+journal acknowledgement; reads
use primary/majority. There is no TTL or automatic cleanup. Backup/restore must
preserve this collection: losing claim history invalidates duplicate prevention.
This API does not replace a fixture lease or serialize different request IDs that
target the same app or glasses.

Run `bun test packages/core/src/services/test-run-claim.service.test.ts` from
`cloud-v2`. Opt-in Mongo tests use `TEST_RUN_CLAIM_MONGO_URI=mongodb://127.0.0.1:PORT`
and `bun test packages/core/src/services/test-run-claim.mongo.test.ts`; they reject
remote/authenticated URLs and create/drop their own uniquely named test database.
No worker registration, queue, deployment or hardware execution is enabled here.
