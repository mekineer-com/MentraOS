# Recovery Worker

The recovery worker is a headless companion APK (`com.mentra.recovery`) that keeps ASG alive when the main service crashes or fails to restart after an APK install.

## Responsibilities

- Send periodic ping heartbeats to ASG.
- Detect heartbeat timeout and enter reset mode.
- Attempt `ACTION_RESTART_SERVICE` first.
- If restart fails, reinstall `/storage/emulated/0/asg/asg_client_backup.apk`.
- Emit telemetry events back to ASG for reporting.

## State machine

- `HEALTHY`
- `SUSPECTED_DEAD`
- `RESTARTING`
- `REINSTALLING_BACKUP`
- `COOLDOWN`
- `FAILED_NEEDS_MANUAL`

## Start contract

ASG deploys the worker through the OEM installer, which leaves the package in Android's
"stopped" state until one of its components has run. Stopped packages receive no
broadcasts (the system adds `FLAG_EXCLUDE_STOPPED_PACKAGES` to every broadcast) and no
`BOOT_COMPLETED`, so a freshly deployed worker cannot wake itself. Every ASG-to-worker
intent (start request, downgrade handoff, install notifications, heartbeat pong) must
therefore be built with `RecoveryWorkerManager.newRecoveryIntent`, which adds
`FLAG_INCLUDE_STOPPED_PACKAGES`. Only the manifest-registered `RecoveryControlReceiver`
actions (start request, downgrade handoff) can cold-start the worker; delivering one of
them clears the stopped state until the next force-stop or fresh install.

## Backup contract

ASG writes:

- `/storage/emulated/0/asg/asg_client_backup.apk`
- `/storage/emulated/0/asg/asg_client_backup.json`

The recovery worker validates that backup APK package name is `com.mentra.asg_client` before reinstall.

## Integration points

- ASG deploy/start manager: `RecoveryWorkerManager`
- ASG ping responder: `ServiceHeartbeatReceiver`
- Telemetry sink: `RecoveryTelemetryReceiver`
- Recovery sidecar service: `com.mentra.recovery.service.RecoveryService`
