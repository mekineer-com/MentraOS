# - Fetches the PR head into a sibling worktree <repo-dir>-pr-<n> (reused if present).
# - Picks the posting account: the PR author's own gh account cannot approve/request-changes,
#   so PRs authored by the logged-in gh user post through the mentra-release-coordinator App
#   token (GH_ACCOUNT=app); anyone else's PR posts from the logged-in account (GH_ACCOUNT=own).
#   Override with GH_ACCOUNT=app|own in the environment.
# - Writes the standard review prompt (plus optional extra instructions) and runs
#   codex-review.sh, which adds the stall/total watchdog and one retry.
# - Prints Codex's final message; artifacts land in $CODEX_REVIEW_HOME (default ~/.codex-reviews).

4b. Also evaluate whether the change is needed or desirable at all, independently of its quality:
   what problem it solves and whether that problem is real for this project, whether the
   repository already has or is moving toward a different solution (check AGENTS.md, notes/,
   agents/, docs and recent commits on the base branch), whether the added surface area,
   dependencies or maintenance burden are justified by the benefit, and whether a smaller change
   would do. State your conclusion explicitly in the review body under a heading \"Is this change
   needed?\" and let it weigh in the verdict: a clean implementation of an unneeded or undesirable
   change is still a request-changes."

You are reviewing GitHub pull request #${pr} in ${slug} ("${title}", author ${author}).
This checkout is the PR head (commit ${head_sha}); the base branch is origin/${base}.

Do the following, in order:

1. Read the PR description: \`gh pr view ${pr} -R ${slug} --json title,body\`.
2. Read the full diff against the base branch: \`git diff origin/${base}...HEAD\`. Read surrounding
   code wherever the diff alone is not enough to judge correctness. Follow the repository's
   AGENTS.md / CLAUDE.md conventions.
3. Read every existing comment on the PR, including bots (Codex connector, Cursor Bugbot, cubic,
   github-actions): \`gh api repos/${slug}/issues/${pr}/comments\`,
   \`gh api repos/${slug}/pulls/${pr}/comments\`, and \`gh pr view ${pr} -R ${slug} --json reviews\`.
   Judge each comment on its merits; do not accept a comment as correct just because it exists,
   and do not reject the PR merely because a comment is unresolved if the head already addresses it.
4. Review for correctness, reliability, and coherent high-level design. Favour low complexity and
   reliability and a coherent design over patchy fixes made only to satisfy review comments.
   Check backwards compatibility, thread-safety, error handling, and whether tests cover the new
   behaviour.${need_step}
5. You may run cheap local tests or compile checks in the touched packages if they help you decide,
   but do not spend more than a few minutes on builds.
6. Do NOT edit any files, do NOT commit, and do NOT push.
7. Finish by posting your verdict on the PR itself using exactly one of:
   \`gh pr review ${pr} -R ${slug} --approve --body "<body>"\` or
   \`gh pr review ${pr} -R ${slug} --request-changes --body "<body>"\`.
   If GitHub refuses the formal review, post \`gh pr review ${pr} -R ${slug} --comment --body "<body>"\`
   whose first line is "Approve." or "Request changes." and say in your final message that you fell back.
   The body must start with "Reviewed by local Codex (gpt-6.1-sol, medium)." and then list: what
   you checked (files/areas, tests/builds run), each existing comment and whether you agree with it
   and why, any defects found with file:line references and a suggested coherent fix, the
   "Is this change needed?" conclusion, and the reason for the verdict. Keep it
   concise and factual.

Your final message must contain the verdict (Approve or Request changes) and the same list, plus the
command you used to post it and whether it succeeded.
