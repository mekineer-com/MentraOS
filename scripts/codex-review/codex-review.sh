# Runs one local Codex PR review under a watchdog so a stalled model response can
# never block the caller: no event from the child for STALL_SECONDS, or MAX_SECONDS
# in total, kills the attempt; one retry, then a clear failure.
#
# usage: codex-review.sh <repo-dir> <repo-name> <output-file> <prompt-file>
#
# Progress is read from the child's own `--json` event stream, written to
# <output-file's directory>/events-<attempt>.jsonl, so other Codex sessions on
# the machine (Codex Desktop, another review) cannot be mistaken for this one.
#
# When REVIEW_SLUG, REVIEW_PR, REVIEW_HEAD and REVIEW_STARTED_AT are set (the
# wrapper sets them), a review receipt on the PR counts as success even if the
# attempt then crashed, so a posted verdict is never retried into a duplicate.

# Cleanup has to survive Codex exiting first. Codex runs tool commands in sessions
# of their own; when Codex dies before the watchdog acts they re-parent to init and
# can no longer be found by walking down from its pid. Two independent views are
# therefore combined: the descendant tree is snapshotted on every poll while the
# parent is alive, and every attempt is launched with a unique CODEX_REVIEW_ATTEMPT
# marker in its environment, which each descendant inherits and which can be found
# by scanning process environments after the fact (procfs on Linux, `ps -E` on
# macOS). The group and every pid found either way get SIGTERM, then SIGKILL, and
# each is verified dead. A survivor is a hard failure: the runner neither retries
# nor trusts a receipt, because a late `gh pr review` from it could still post.
