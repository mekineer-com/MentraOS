# NIMO Dynamic Layout V1 integration

## What the handoff contains

The September 8, 2026 `mentra-android-20260908` handoff is a source patch for
NIMO glasses, not an APK or a firmware update. Its README identifies the baseline
as `e4156a951bbf1627f139325ad098f90828e93c3d` and the Android/shared snapshot as
`a6a50b0fc92ea6b6a0a3a9aba913af881e283e81`. All three files passed its supplied
SHA256SUMS checks before integration.

The patch replaces fixed text/map widgets with the vendor's 500×220 Dynamic
Layout V1 canvas. It includes positioned text, rectangles, compressed 2bpp
images, serialized Bluetooth writes and business acknowledgements, scene
restoration, Android navigation/location lifecycle fixes, and miniapp updates.
The original delivery explicitly excluded iOS.

This integration merges those changes onto `dev` and adds the corresponding
native Apple canvas encoder, image decoder, command state machine, CoreBluetooth
write queue, and scene/brightness/welcome handling. Existing immediate miniapp
CONNECT_ACK delivery and deferred dashboard cleanup on `dev` are preserved.
Android debug framebuffer diagnostics remain debug-only; they are not required
by the iOS implementation or production transport.

## Firmware and packaging

Use the vendor-supplied `537cf1` dynamic-v1 firmware. The handoff identifies its
stock OTA file by SHA256
`5e23c574e3dfd8c27172f4f9a33475e6efd0d33e7230bfcce8f4fe8ca59fe433`.
That is an artifact identifier, not an assertion about firmware installed on a
connected device. Earlier pre-canvas firmware is not compatible with this path.
This change does not distribute or install firmware.

Captions 1.0.18, Translation 1.0.21, Teleprompter 1.0.8, and Navigation 1.1.32 are
rebuilt from this checkout in production mode, then installed in
`mobile/assets/miniapps/` and included by the generated bundle manifest. Maps uses
the workspace's `EXPO_PUBLIC_MAPBOX_ACCESS_TOKEN`; the development token from the
handoff's prebuilt Maps archive is replaced. The separate Mapbox downloads
credential remains a build-time prerequisite for native Maps dependencies.

Apple dependencies are the system ImageIO and zlib libraries, declared in the
Bluetooth SDK podspec. Both platforms require a native app rebuild.

## Protocol and lifecycle

- The host submits a complete ordered scene. NIMO ignores per-element diff hints
  because every Update replaces the canvas, including text/image transitions.
- Launch, Update, and Exit use app ID `0xFD`. Frame fragments fit the negotiated
  characteristic write capacity, including the eight-byte transport header.
- Each completed connection handshake requests the canvas immediately, restoring
  the newest retained scene or an empty canvas if no miniapp has submitted one.
  An unknown peer-Companion state no longer waits for the firmware's first
  unsolicited heartbeat (observed 60 seconds after reconnect). Launch itself
  validates TWS/peer readiness in firmware; its ACK must precede Update. A known
  disconnected peer still blocks transmission.
- Explicit status 7 (NOT_READY) allows up to three Launch retries, one second
  apart, while the transport remains ready. Fresh heartbeats retain their
  separate bounded recovery budget. Exit, disconnect and known readiness loss
  cancel pending probes. Status 8 blocks until reconnect; ambiguous/missing ACKs
  still retire the transport.
- A business ACK confirms command acceptance, not optical rendering. It cannot
  advance the command state until the last GATT write completes. Ambiguous
  timeouts/errors retire the connection rather than reusing the command key.
- The most recent desired scene survives reconnect and stock-UI reports. While
  Mentra owns the display, native app entry/canvas exit requests a serialized
  re-Launch and scene replay, even without another miniapp render call. These
  reports do not discard pending encoding. Explicit host Exit clears ownership;
  scene changes, Exit and disconnect still invalidate stale encoding results.
- NIMO opts out of temporary welcome and brightness text so delayed clears cannot
  erase the active scene. Hidden dashboard updates never clear the visible view.
- Images are bounded before decoding, resized to their destination, composited
  over black, and packed with the same luminance/polarity as Android. Text,
  object, pixel, and serialized-frame budgets are validated before transmission.
- Host scene admission enforces the aggregate limits before resolving `render()`.
  It counts nonempty wrapped rows and borders, UTF-8 text bytes, destination
  image pixels, and a conservative encoded-byte bound from the device profile.
  Image reservations use worst-case literal RLE size, so highly compressible
  scenes can be dropped sooner than native compression strictly requires.
  Overflowing elements appear in `dropped`; accepted later elements can still
  use the remaining budget. Native retains its final validation.

## Validation and remaining device acceptance

### iOS discovery prerequisite

NIMO serves Companion service `7033` over classic Bluetooth (BR/EDR). Pair the
main NIMO device in **iPhone Settings → Bluetooth** first, wait for **Connected**,
then return to the Mentra App. The separate name ending in `_BLE` is the ANCS
side channel and does not expose the Companion data service. The iOS driver
enumerates system-connected devices and registers for service connection events,
so both an existing connection and pairing in Settings during discovery are handled.
See Apple's [Core Bluetooth BR/EDR walkthrough](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2019/901/).

For physical-iPhone acceptance, start with the NIMO app closed and a recorded
app/OS/firmware version. Verify the preparation instruction, pair the main device
in Settings, return, select it in the Mentra App, and reach a completed handshake.
Repeat with a device already connected before scanning, and with Settings pairing
after scanning starts. Verify `_BLE` never appears as a selectable data device,
cancel scanning before connecting in Settings to check no unsolicited connection,
then explicitly retry. Reconnect and run Captions to verify the data path. Restore
the fixture's original pairing state and retain timestamps/logs for failed steps.
These physical checks remain required; simulated discovery tests are not device
acceptance. No currently registered device routine covers NIMO iPhone pairing.

### Canvas acceptance

Automated coverage includes the vendor's exact packet examples, both command
and transport lifecycles, image compression round trips, scene handoff,
foreground visibility, notification restoration, phone location, and miniapp
layout behavior. Apple tests run through the SDK's Swift package; its export
script also builds for generic iOS. Android checks use the generated Expo
project through `scripts/check-android-compile.sh`.

The original Android handoff reports controlled glasses evidence for Captions,
Translation, Mentra AI, Recorder, Teleprompter, and the Maps HUD. Most of that
work used firmware with a private framebuffer-readback extension. It is not
acceptance evidence for the final merged build or the new iOS port.

Run the following on **both Android and iOS**, recording app build, phone/OS,
glasses firmware, and device logs. Use the exact unmodified dynamic-v1 firmware.

1. Pair/reconnect, then run Captions with real microphone audio. Confirm wrapped
   rows, blank rows, Unicode, and changing partial text render correctly.
2. With a persistent miniapp scene active, disconnect/reconnect Bluetooth. Check
   that the scene remains visible beyond the former three-second welcome clear.
3. Switch Captions, Translation, Teleprompter, and Maps. Change brightness and
   auto-brightness; show/dismiss notifications; change the selected app while a
   notification covers it. The newest scene must return without stale content.
4. Exercise head-up/head-down and contextual dashboard toggles, including a
   dashboard scene replaced by legacy text. Check physical controls and native
   app takeover/return.
5. Background, lock, and return to the phone with real transcription active.
   Test longer sessions and removal/replacement of an arm to exercise readiness.
6. Walk a real Maps route: combined maneuver/arrow/distance/time/map HUD, reroute,
   normal arrival, stop/start another route, and ending navigation clearing the
   scene. Simulated routes do not establish physical-navigation acceptance.
7. Check any applicable remaining miniapps. The handoff reported Notes startup
   HTTP 401 and Merge provider-credit errors; recheck those service dependencies
   before claiming all-miniapp acceptance. Camera flows do not apply to this
   NIMO model, which also does not advertise a speaker.

No physical Android or iOS acceptance of this merged candidate is claimed.


## Text rendering migration

The handoff's per-miniapp NIMO profiles have been replaced by a migration to
host-owned text fitting. Captions and Translation supply transcript history in
one text element with `maxLines` and `textWindow: "end"`. Teleprompter uses
optional render feedback (visible lines and source line starts) while retaining
its own script, word cursor, voice matching, and replacement-frame behavior.
All three copied display-utils trees are removed. They require host 3.2.1.

The existing text element supports optional `maxLines`, `textWindow`, and
`verticalAlign`. Defaults preserve existing callers. G1/Z100 compile the new
controls using their text budgets and bypass a second legacy wrapping pass.
Replays retain source text and recompile against the current device's metrics.
G2 blank-row escaping is performed by the Android/iOS driver, not Teleprompter.
Public API details are in the display documentation. The earlier display design
notes' proposed public measurement helper is superseded; no helper or scroll
API is added to the SDK.

For acceptance, also check caption line-count/width/top-bottom settings with
interim speech, transcript previews, Teleprompter voice-follow and timed play,
manual forward/back steps, its timecode footer, final-page behavior, and changing
glasses during a read. Automated checks do not replace these hardware tests.

### Immediate canvas reconnect regression

On stock dynamic-v1 firmware, keep the Mac disconnected and use the paired
physical Android phone. Record the handshake, canvas Launch response and app
state `0xFD` entry timestamps. A cold app launch with no active miniapp must
enter an empty canvas promptly, before the first minute heartbeat. Run Captions,
confirm visible glasses text, then disconnect/reconnect with the miniapp still
running. Confirm the retained scene returns without waiting for new speech.
Exercise a glasses gesture that returns to stock UI and confirm Mentra restores
its canvas while it owns a scene. An explicit host Exit must remain exited.
Save logs and wearer confirmation; a successful business ACK alone is not proof
of visible rendering. Repeat on a physical iPhone when available.
