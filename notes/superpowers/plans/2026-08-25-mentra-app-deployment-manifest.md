# Mentra Private Deployment call implementation plan

> Execution checklist for the first customer deployment: the official Mentra
> App, bundled Mentra Call, Microsoft Entra, customer-hosted Core plus a reduced
> Runtime Services process, and direct Teams participation through ACS. Do not
> package Store or a dedicated Mentra Call backend for this milestone.

**Goal:** Run Mentra Call on Android and iOS in a restricted customer-controlled
workspace without Mentra public Core, Runtime, Store, or miniapp services.

**Architecture:** The app resolves a workspace manifest before authentication.
The first customer template selects native Microsoft Entra sign-in, points to
the customer Core and Runtime, and enables approved bundled miniapps. Core
verifies the Entra identity, creates the deployment-scoped session, and mints
the short-lived Runtime token. One Runtime process enables only the
meeting-provider module. Mentra Live sends media directly to the phone over
SoftAP; the phone publishes raw media through ACS to Teams. The same cached
Entra account can supply the delegated token exchanged for an authenticated
Teams-user ACS token, with no second interactive login. Mentra Call invokes
host capabilities and has no required backend in this profile.

**Tech stack:** React Native/Expo, TypeScript, Android/iOS MSAL, local MentraJS,
native ACS Calling SDK, direct SoftAP glasses-to-phone transport, modular Cloud
V2 Runtime Services, and coordinated GitHub releases.

**Spec source of truth:**

## Product acceptance consumed from Mentra Call

This plan consumes one bounded Mentra Call product slice; it is not the master
Mentra Call roadmap and does not reuse the older V1/V1.5/V2/V3 numbering.

- Join an existing Microsoft 365 work/school Teams meeting from a pasted URL.
- Show one primary **Join Teams call** action plus clear SoftAP connection,
  joining, in-call, failure, recovery, and leave states.
- Use the direct SoftAP glasses-to-phone media path; do not provision a public
  streaming relay for this enterprise profile.
- Preserve one unambiguous outgoing-microphone policy. Use the phone microphone
  unless the integrated SoftAP contract qualifies glasses microphone audio;
  incoming Teams audio plays through the glasses.
- Target 1280x720 at 15 fps and less than two seconds of measured end-to-end
  latency at the Teams receiver under the reference network.
- Leave tears down local media and ACS resources, confirms exit, and returns
  home.
- No meeting creation, Graph/calendar permission, invite flow, chat, Google Meet,
  Zoom, or public WHIP/WHEP relay is required for the first enterprise release.

Nicolo's branch may use an ACS guest identity named `Mentra Live` to qualify the
native media path. The enterprise integration supports that authenticated guest
mode and can additionally use the signed-in employee's Entra/Teams identity
without adding a second interactive login.

## Execution lanes

### Lane A: Alex — unblocked enterprise/platform foundations from `dev`

Phases 1, 2, Phase 3 Task 1, and Phase 4 can proceed without the native ACS
branch. Lane A owns deployment resolution, Entra, customer-Core identity and
session exchange, Core-issued Runtime authentication, modular Runtime boot, the
server-side ACS exchange, and the Azure reference service. The Runtime meetings
endpoint is exercised through a server-side harness; Lane A does not connect it
to native ACS.

### Lane B: Nicolo — native ACS/media branch

The owner of `nicolo/acs-teams-v1` retains the native ACS module and raw-media
implementation, audio policy, current Miniapp SDK meeting request, and Mentra
Call ACS controller. The enterprise integration must adapt its input to the
direct SoftAP source before qualification. Lane A does not edit or replace
those files.

### Lane C: Alex + Nicolo — post-merge integration

Phase 3 Task 2, Phase 5, final bundling, and end-to-end call qualification begin
after Lane B lands on `dev`. This lane connects the trusted native host to the
already-qualified Runtime meetings endpoint and finalizes the Miniapp SDK call
contract with the native implementation's owner.

Lane A exits when the official app can resolve a customer manifest, sign in with
Entra, and authenticate through customer Core to a reduced Runtime; that
Runtime starts only the meetings HTTP module and issues a guest ACS credential
through a server-side harness. The harness also completes an ACS Teams-user
exchange when delegated credentials are configured. Lane A is not expected to
place a Teams call.

### Merge gates

1. Ship the design and all Lane A work together in this Alex-owned PR based on
   current `dev`; it does not import or modify Nicolo's ACS branch. Keep the
   work reviewable as staged commits inside the PR.
2. Nicolo rebases or merges current `dev`, qualifies the guest ACS media path,
   and lands Lane B as its own focused PR. Lane B does not wait for enterprise
   Entra or Runtime work.
3. Once this PR and Lane B are on `dev`, create Lane C from fresh
   `dev`. Jointly finalize the provider-neutral host/Miniapp SDK boundary and
   replace miniapp credential pass-through with host-owned Runtime exchange.
4. Pin and bundle the matching Mentra Call package only after Lane C's contract
   is stable, then run the complete Azure reference deployment qualification.

## Phase 1: Deployment contract and pre-network boot

### Task 1: Add the typed deployment resolver

**Files:**

- Create `mobile/modules/engine/src/runtime/deployment.ts`
- Modify `mobile/modules/engine/src/runtime/bootstrap.ts`
- Create `mobile/src/services/deployment/DeploymentService.ts`
- Create `mobile/src/services/deployment/embeddedDeployment.ts`
- Add resolver/schema tests beside those files

- [ ] Define manifest v1 as an override of the complete embedded Mentra profile.
      Arrays replace; explicit null disables nullable destinations; validation
      runs on the resolved profile.
- [ ] Make `coreUrl` and `runtimeUrl` nullable without localhost or Mentra
      fallbacks.
- [ ] Retain package-name-keyed `systemMiniapps.configuration` for genuine
      package-specific values, but keep Runtime URLs and auth scopes at the host
      deployment level.
- [ ] Add `auth.mode: "microsoft-entra"` with exact authority URL, native client
      id, customer Core session scope, and ACS Teams delegated scopes. Request no Graph
      scope in the first call-focused template.
- [ ] Add `features.runtimeRealtimeSession`; false disables Runtime WebSocket,
      audio, and subscriptions while preserving authenticated Runtime REST
      capabilities.
- [ ] Generate the embedded Mentra profile from coordinated build inputs. It
      keeps `auth.mode: "mentra-account"`, public Core/Runtime, and the ordinary
      consumer feature set.
- [ ] Restore the selected deployment before showing auth or starting a network
      integration.
- [ ] Persist workspace origin and last valid manifest under `deploymentId`.
- [ ] Namespace credentials, settings, miniapp state, and caches by
      `deploymentId`.
- [ ] Require HTTPS outside development. Do not couple a deployment manifest to
      one exact mobile release.
- [ ] Use Runtime's common unauthenticated `/api/client/min-version` policy for
      required and recommended app-version floors. Keep Core's existing route
      temporarily for already-released clients.
- [ ] Validate all URLs, deployment links, package names, glasses model ids, and
      Entra authority/scopes.
- [ ] Reject `common`, `organizations`, personal Microsoft accounts, and any
      authority not pinned to the declared first-pilot tenant.
- [ ] Test that null Core never resolves to an embedded Mentra endpoint and the
      selected customer Runtime never falls back to Mentra Runtime.

### Task 2: Gate the React and native startup paths

**Files:**

- Modify `mobile/src/app/_layout.tsx`
- Modify `mobile/src/contexts/AllProviders.tsx`
- Create `mobile/src/contexts/DeploymentContext.tsx`
- Modify native analytics configuration on Android and iOS
- Add boot-route and clean-install tests

- [ ] Load deployment state before mounting consumer `AuthProvider`.
- [ ] Move Sentry, PostHog, and Firebase Analytics behind the resolved master
      telemetry switch.
- [ ] Default native collection off before JavaScript/profile resolution.
- [ ] Render a fully local landing screen when no deployment is selected.
- [ ] Render local recovery/setup UI if a first custom manifest cannot load.
- [ ] Add clean-install packet-capture coverage proving no telemetry or Mentra
      service starts while a workspace is unresolved.

### Task 3: Add manual workspace enrollment

**Files:**

- Modify `mobile/src/app/auth/start.tsx`
- Create `mobile/src/app/auth/workspace.tsx`
- Create `mobile/src/services/deployment/WorkspaceDeploymentService.ts`
- Modify login translations, starting with `mobile/src/i18n/en.ts`
- Add the well-known manifest route to the reduced Runtime HTTP profile
- Modify logout/reset utilities

- [ ] Preserve current Google, Apple, and email controls and add a visually
      separate Connect to a workspace action.
- [ ] Make consumer actions activate the embedded profile before auth.
- [ ] Ask for an organization address and normalize bare hostnames, homepage
      URLs, and complete well-known manifest URLs to the workspace origin.
- [ ] Fetch `/.well-known/mentra-deployment.json` directly from that origin.
- [ ] Discard pasted paths, queries, and fragments; reject credentials,
      non-HTTPS origins, invalid TLS, oversized responses, and cross-origin
      redirects.
- [ ] Require the configured Runtime URL to match the entered origin.
- [ ] Keep the fetched workspace pending through resolution, schema validation,
      and security-policy validation.
- [ ] Show display name, hostname, and Microsoft organization sign-in before
      activation, with technical details expandable.
- [ ] Provide Back and Cancel before activation. Neither may persist state or
      start providers.
- [ ] Provide Use a different workspace and Return to Mentra before login.
- [ ] Persist `source: "manual"`; do not implement QR, a Mentra directory, or
      managed-app configuration injection in v1.
- [ ] Cache the last valid manifest for disconnected boot and never fall back to
      the consumer profile after custom selection.
- [ ] Clear the cached manifest on workspace logout and return to the neutral
      Mentra/workspace landing screen, including after restart.

## Phase 2: Native Microsoft Entra authentication

### Task 1: Add deployment-scoped MSAL on Android and iOS

**Files:**

- Create `mobile/src/services/auth/DeploymentAuthProvider.ts`
- Add an Expo/native Microsoft Entra auth module for Android and iOS
- Create `mobile/src/services/auth/EntraAuthService.ts`
- Modify auth routing and account context
- Modify secure-storage and logout utilities
- Add unit, native integration, and end-to-end auth tests

- [ ] Initialize MSAL only after a `microsoft-entra` manifest is active.
- [ ] Put MSAL behind `DeploymentAuthProvider`; app navigation, Engine, Runtime
      clients, and miniapps must not import the Entra adapter directly.
- [ ] Configure it dynamically from the exact tenant authority and client id
      while using the official Mentra App's registered native redirect URI.
- [ ] Use Authorization Code + PKCE through the system browser or supported
      Microsoft broker.
- [ ] Persist only MSAL/account state in OS-protected storage, scoped by
      deployment id.
- [ ] Return a canonical workspace identity keyed by deployment, issuer, and
      provider subject. The Entra adapter derives its subject from verified
      `tid` plus `oid`; email remains display metadata only.
- [ ] Acquire the deployment's Core API scope for the selected account and
      refresh it silently.
- [ ] Silently acquire the ACS Teams delegated token for the same account when
      the native meeting capability needs it.
- [ ] Keep consumer Google/Apple/email bound to the embedded Mentra profile.
- [ ] Let the manifest select exactly one workspace auth adapter. Do not show an
      identity-provider picker or disabled "coming soon" providers after a
      workspace is selected.
- [ ] Exchange the verified Entra identity for a deployment-scoped customer
      Core session. Core, not Runtime, owns refresh/logout and token-signing
      state.
- [ ] Implement logout, disabled-user recovery, authority mismatch, token expiry,
      and deployment switching without credential crossover.
- [ ] Test assigned/unassigned users, wrong tenant, MFA, Conditional Access,
      cancelled login, revoked session, and broker/browser return on both
      platforms.

### Task 2: Authenticate through customer Core

**Files:** Core OIDC/session exchange, Engine auth seam, Runtime verifier
config, and deployment guide

- [ ] Validate the exact Entra issuer, tenant, audience, signature, expiry, and
      configured Core API scope during the customer Core exchange.
- [ ] Have customer Core mint the ordinary short-lived Runtime bearer token and
      wire the existing `auth.runtime.getToken` Cloud Client mode through the
      Mentra App/Engine production configuration.
- [ ] Have Runtime validate only customer Core-issued tokens using the
      deployment's pinned issuer and JWKS; do not teach Runtime to accept raw
      workforce tokens as its primary session credential.
- [ ] Authorize only assigned users/groups defined by customer policy.
- [ ] Key server audit events by tenant id and object id; do not persist raw
      identity-provider tokens.
- [ ] Return actionable 401/403 responses without exposing token contents.
- [ ] Document the single-tenant public-client registration, official Android
      and iOS redirects, Enterprise Application assignment, Core session scope,
      and consent.

## Phase 3: Private Deployment Engine and bundled Mentra Call

### Task 1: Make REST-only Runtime startup supported in Engine

**Files:**

- Modify `mobile/modules/engine/src/engine.ts`
- Modify `mobile/modules/engine/src/services/CloudClientService.ts`
- Modify Engine startup services that currently assume cloud auth
- Modify `mobile/src/services/MantleManager.ts`
- Add local-only startup tests

- [ ] Construct the Cloud Client with the selected customer Core and Runtime
      endpoints. Obtain Runtime tokens through the customer Core session using
      the existing host-provided token callback.
- [ ] Expose Runtime REST capabilities without opening the Runtime WebSocket or
      starting cloud audio, reconnect alarms, reports, support-profile sync, or
      cloud registry synchronization.
- [ ] Continue Bluetooth, device hydration, pairing/reconnect, local settings,
      display, local miniapp runtime/launcher, phone stream coordination, ACS,
      and configured OTA.
- [ ] Keep the normal Core-owned opaque Mentra user identity, scoped to the
      deployment, and retain Entra subject metadata only in the Core-issued
      Runtime token for provider integrations that explicitly need it.
- [ ] Do not expose a miniapp-backend token in the call-focused profile. Mentra Call
      uses host capabilities and has no required backend.
- [ ] Fail unavailable cloud-only miniapp APIs explicitly rather than retrying
      localhost or Mentra endpoints.
- [ ] Suppress cloud-disconnected UI/notifications in local-only mode.

### Task 2: Integrate, bundle, and constrain Mentra Call after native ACS lands

**Lane:** C — do not begin from current `dev` or duplicate the native branch.

**Files:**

- Sync the release-pinned Mentra Call package into `mobile/assets/miniapps/`
- Regenerate `mobile/src/generated/bundledMiniapps.ts`
- Modify bundled install/registry/launcher policy
- Integrate the merged Mentra Call ACS work in its external repository
- Add bundle and launch tests

- [ ] Bundle Mentra Call in the official app and approve it in the first
      customer manifest template.
- [ ] Apply `systemMiniapps.approvedPackageNamesOverride` to install, registry,
      menus, autostart, and primary system-miniapp launch surfaces. Do not make
      comprehensive blocking of secondary shared-screen routes a v1 gate.
- [ ] Remove the Mentra Call backend dependency from the ACS path.
- [ ] Keep the Miniapp SDK call request provider-neutral. `session.meeting` is
      the current spike shape, not a frozen API name or payload.
- [ ] Keep ACS/Entra credentials below the trusted host boundary; miniapp
      JavaScript receives no bearer token.
- [ ] Preserve existing Teams/ACS join, leave, mute, state, recovery, and
      incoming-audio behavior from `nicolo/acs-teams-v1`, replacing the WHEP
      source with the integrated SoftAP source.
- [ ] Present one primary Join Teams call action and accept an existing
      Microsoft 365 work/school Teams URL.
- [ ] Show clear SoftAP connection and recovery UX when the glasses-to-phone
      media source cannot start or is interrupted.
- [ ] Leave tears down the local media source and ACS call, confirms exit, and
      returns to Mentra Call home.
- [ ] Do not add meeting creation, calendar, invite, chat, Google Meet, Zoom, or
      public streaming-relay work to this integration task.

## Phase 4: Modular Runtime Services

### Task 1: Compose enabled Runtime modules in one process

**Files:** Runtime startup, API composition, provider validation, container,
Azure template, tests, and operator documentation

- [ ] Add an explicit positive allowlist: `RUNTIME_SERVICES=meetings` for the
      first enterprise template.
- [ ] Select provider implementations independently with
      `MEETING_PROVIDERS=acs-teams`; enabling a module must not implicitly select
      a vendor.
- [ ] Keep one Runtime binary, process, HTTP port, and container. Do not create a
      container or repository per module.
- [ ] Register routes and initialize providers only for enabled modules.
- [ ] Fail startup when an enabled module has missing or invalid required
      configuration. Do not infer enablement from API-key presence.
- [ ] Do not connect Redis, bind UDP, spawn audio workers, start ownership loops,
      or accept Runtime WebSockets when the real-time/audio module is disabled.
- [ ] Do not initialize storage/photos, maps, TTS, or speech providers when their
      modules are disabled.
- [ ] Serve the exact deployment manifest at the well-known path from a mounted
      release-matched file.
- [ ] Publish health/readiness that reports enabled-module configuration without
      disclosing secrets.

### Task 2: Add the Runtime meetings provider

**Files:** Runtime meetings API/provider, ACS Identity SDK integration,
server-side qualification harness, token/redaction tests, and Azure configuration

- [ ] Add an `acs-teams` provider behind the Runtime meetings capability.
- [ ] Require a valid Core-issued Runtime API bearer token for every credential
      request. An absent delegated token requests a guest credential.
- [ ] When a delegated Entra token is supplied, validate tenant, client/app id,
      object id, scopes, expiry, and that the subject matches the authenticated
      Runtime user. Reject an invalid supplied token instead of falling back to
      a guest.
- [ ] Exchange it with ACS `GetTokenForTeamsUser` using customer-owned ACS
      managed identity/RBAC where supported, with a rotated connection-string
      secret permitted for the first controlled deployment.
- [ ] Create or reuse an anonymous ACS communication user and issue a `voip`
      token when no delegated token is supplied.
- [ ] Serialize guest issuance per authenticated user, bound idle in-process
      identity state, and preserve reusable ACS user IDs across transient
      provider failures.
- [ ] Return a short-lived guest or Teams-user ACS token, with the selected
      identity mode, in a stable response that Lane C can consume; do not add
      mobile/native integration in Lane A.
- [ ] Keep Entra and ACS bearer tokens out of miniapp messages, logs, errors, and
      diagnostics.
- [ ] Require ACS configuration at module startup. Require Entra tenant/client
      configuration only when the Teams-user exchange path is exercised; require
      no Cloudflare, MongoDB, Recall, speech, Store, or Mentra cloud variables.

## Phase 5: Reuse Entra for authenticated Teams identity

The existing native path proves raw media with a guest token. A Private
Deployment uses the employee Teams identity when a delegated token is available
and otherwise remains capable of joining as a guest. It reuses Phase 2; there is
no second interactive SSO screen.

**Lane:** C — begin only after the native ACS/media branch lands on `dev`.

### Task 1: Add host-owned ACS credential acquisition

**Files:** MSAL scope acquisition, native host/Engine call capability, Nicolo ACS
native module integration, tests, and admin guide

- [ ] Add delegated ACS `Teams.ManageCalls` and `Teams.ManageChats` permissions
      to the Entra registration and document admin consent/assignment.
- [ ] Silently acquire an ACS-scoped Entra token for the same cached MSAL account
      when available and send it only to the configured customer Runtime over
      TLS. A non-Entra identity, or an unavailable delegated token, requests a
      guest credential instead.
- [ ] Have the trusted host obtain and refresh the short-lived employee or guest
      ACS credential from Runtime; do not put it in the Miniapp SDK request.
- [ ] Treat `session.meeting.join` as the current spike shape. Finalize a
      provider-neutral Miniapp SDK capability only after the native lifecycle is
      stable.
- [ ] Confirm the Android and iOS Calling SDK agent construction required by a
      Teams-user token while retaining raw media.
- [ ] Test same-tenant and external meetings, employee roster identity, lobby
      policy, disabled user, token expiry/refresh, revoked consent, missing Teams
      license, and Conditional Access.

## Phase 6: Deployment policy, artifacts, and qualification

### Task 1: Enforce content, hardware, and egress policy

**Files:** Existing wallpaper/link/update/miniapp/pairing/telemetry call sites and
policy tests

- [ ] Use only `content.wallpaperUrls`; empty means no remote presets.
- [ ] Route privacy, terms, docs, support, store, and review actions through
      resolved fields. Do not add `externalLinks`.
- [ ] Apply the approved system-miniapp list to installation, registry, system
      miniapp catalogs and menus, autostart, and primary launch surfaces. The
      embedded Mentra profile uses `null`; the customer template pins Mentra Call
      and explicitly approved utilities. Secondary shell routes to shared
      built-in screens are not part of the v1 acceptance gate.
- [ ] Filter every pairing entry point with `glasses.allowedModelsOverride`;
      keep vendor behavior in model adapters and do not add AR99-specific
      schema. Allowing a model authorizes pairing, not public vendor traffic;
      vendor integrations without manifest-selected endpoints fail closed.
- [ ] Disable navigation, cloud speech, cloud reports, public store/registry, and
      any other unavailable integration in the call-focused template.
- [ ] Add an integration inventory test asserting every known network path is
      selected, disabled, or explicitly approved by the active profile.

### Task 2: Publish customer artifacts and guides

**Files:** Coordinated release scripts/workflows, Mintlify docs, cloud deployment
templates, and runbooks

- [ ] Publish a release-matched call-focused deployment template.
- [x] Publish the common `mentra-cloud` image once through public GHCR with an
      immutable digest, signed SPDX SBOM and build provenance; mirror that exact
      digest into the Azure reference deployment and start it separately as
      Core and as Runtime with only `meetings` enabled.
- [ ] Publish customer-hostable Mentra Live OTA artifacts when OTA is enabled.
- [ ] Reuse the exact normal Android and iOS app artifacts; no customer build
      lane.
- [ ] Document Android APK/MDM and iOS App Store/Apple Business Manager
      distribution. State that workspace entry is manual in v1.
- [ ] Publish a Microsoft Entra guide for native app redirects, single-tenant
      authority, API permissions/scopes, assignment, consent, revocation, and
      troubleshooting.
- [ ] Publish an ACS Runtime guide that lists only the required meetings module
      and secret, supports rotation, and explains Teams-user identity.
- [ ] Document that restricted-network means customer-approved Microsoft and
      ACS/Teams egress, not zero internet.

### Task 3: Qualify the Mentra Azure reference deployment

**Files:** Mentra Azure environment and end-to-end test records

- [ ] Deploy customer Core plus one reduced Runtime process in Mentra's Azure
      account using Mentra's non-production Entra tenant and customer-style
      isolation.
- [ ] Use a customer-style ACS resource and secret store/managed identity.
- [ ] Deploy customer Core and Runtime without using Mentra public Core/Runtime.
- [ ] Select the workspace using official Android and iOS Mentra App artifacts.
- [ ] Run Entra assignment, MFA, wrong-tenant, disabled-user, expiry, logout, and
      deployment-switch tests.
- [ ] Run Teams join, mute, incoming audio, SoftAP interruption/recovery, leave,
      and 30–60 minute soak tests on Android and iOS.
- [ ] At the Teams receiver, record observed resolution, frame rate, bitrate,
      and end-to-end latency; qualify the 1280x720 at 15 fps and less-than-two-
      second targets under the documented reference network.
- [ ] Verify join-only UX: pasted work Teams URL, SoftAP connection/recovery,
      call state, explicit leave confirmation, resource teardown, and return
      home.
- [ ] Run packet capture with Mentra public services blocked and fail on any
      unapproved destination.
- [ ] Re-run ordinary consumer release gates with the embedded Mentra profile.

## Suggested commit stages inside the Lane A implementation PR

1. Manifest types/resolver, landing screen, manual workspace flow, nullable
   Core/Runtime, and pre-network telemetry gating.
2. Provider-neutral auth contract plus native Entra adapter,
   deployment-scoped Core session, secure logout, and Core-issued Runtime token
   provider.
3. Runtime module composition plus the meetings-only HTTP profile.
4. Runtime meetings/ACS guest issuance and Teams-user token exchange, exercised
   through a server-side qualification harness with no native/mobile changes.
5. OTA/content/hardware policy, Azure template, guides, and restricted-network
   qualification scaffolding.

Native ACS integration remains the separate Lane C PR after Nicolo's Lane B
lands. Do not add delegated Graph meeting creation to either V1 lane.

The narrowed call deployment packages customer Core and Runtime from the same
immutable image while omitting Store and unrelated Runtime modules. It still
requires real mobile work—native Entra login, deployment-scoped Core sessions,
modular Runtime boot, and secure ACS credential ownership—but those changes
form a reusable foundation for later workspace profiles.

## Explicitly deferred Mentra Call follow-ons

These remain valid product directions but are not tasks or merge gates for this
implementation plan:

- Create a Teams meeting as the signed-in user with delegated Graph
  `OnlineMeetings.ReadWrite`; remove any shared licensed Graph service-account
  flow from an eventual enterprise creation path.
- Copy/share invite links, calendar discovery, chat, TTS of chat, custom display
  names, and additional in-call controls.
- Google Meet and Zoom enterprise qualification and their corresponding
  customer-controlled provider infrastructure.
- Public WHIP/WHEP or other cloud-relay media providers for the enterprise
  profile.

## Branch and dependency strategy

Do not build the entire effort on `nicolo/acs-teams-v1`. At the time of this
plan, that branch has no pull request, is 52 commits ahead and 108 commits behind
`dev`, and contains approximately 4,900 lines of native/media/API changes. It is
the source of the ACS media implementation, not the base for unrelated manifest,
auth, or Runtime work.

- Keep the design and the single Lane A manifest, Entra, Runtime-auth, and
  modular-Runtime implementation together in this PR from current `dev`; it
  does not depend on Nicolo's branch.
- Have Nicolo rebase or merge current `dev` into `nicolo/acs-teams-v1`, validate
  Android/iOS, and open its own focused PR for the native ACS/media capability.
- If native integration must proceed before that PR merges, create a narrowly
  scoped stacked branch from `nicolo/acs-teams-v1` and target that branch. Do not
  mix Runtime or deployment-manifest work into the stack.
- After the native ACS PR and this Lane A PR land, create the final
  integration PR from fresh `dev` and adapt the spike Miniapp SDK contract so
  credentials stay below the host boundary.
- PR #3743 is compatible but not a dependency. If its Store/Core split lands
  first, rebase normally; do not copy its tentative implementation or make this
  deployment wait for it.
