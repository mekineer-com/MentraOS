# Coordinated dev/staging device requests

Keep the PR request schema and opt-in unchanged. Add a distinct schema version 2
for existing coordinated releases; a release is never represented as a PR.
The public request workflow runs from `dev`. Manual selection supplies `channel`
(`dev` or `staging`), `source_build_run_id`, `source_publication_attempt`, `routine`
and `request_origin: workflow-dispatch`. Both selectors are mandatory for releases.

The source is `{kind: coordinated-release, channel, buildRunId, publicationAttempt}`.
An exact completed successful `coordinated-release.yml` attempt must belong to the
same repository/channel, and its source must be an ancestor of the current channel.
Historical builds are allowed; advancing a branch does not silently choose a newer
artifact or require the selected source to equal the branch tip.

The producing run's single retained release-plan artifact supplies its immutable
release identity. The corresponding published plan must match source, channel and
container. Reuse `downloadNames` / `validateDownloads` to bind its Apple receipt,
Mac archive, native/JavaScript hashes and OTA manifest. Staging uses the existing
`beta` release identity and staging backend. Recheck source evidence after reads.

`selection` retains `platform`, `receipt`, `archive`, `otaManifest` and unmodified
`app`; it adds `releasePlan`. `selection.build` contains `sourceCommit`,
`releaseIdentity`, `artifactContainerTag`. The producer has `runId`,
`publicationAttempt`, `workflow`, `url`; there is no invented native build attempt.
Request IDs are `routine-{requestRun}-{requestAttempt}-{channel}-{routine}`.
The synthetic shared wire fixture is
`.github/scripts/fixtures/coordinated-routine-request.json`.

After a successful coordinated run, the existing trusted callback requests only
`no-glasses`, with authorization `successful-build`. It passes exact source
selectors to the dev issuer, then forwards only the authenticated request run/attempt
to the existing private queue. The private worker independently authenticates,
prepares, claims, records and publishes the result.

One coordinated source run retains one automatic generation per routine across
all its rerun attempts because the existing release plan/identity is reused.
The authenticated callback send-step history is the durable fence. Concurrency
serializes only callbacks for that source/routine. An entered send with an unknown
acknowledgement requires manual reconciliation; there is no SDK retry. Deleting
history never authorizes another automatic generation. Explicit manual requests
remain separate generations and require deliberate operator action.

The existing dev/staging Slack post includes pending request status, its callback
pipeline and results filtered by repository, exact source SHA, archive SHA256,
routine and platform. It does not wait for a worker or claim that a test ran/passed.
No production source is supported.

## Integration and qualification

Deploy the private schema2/cache/export adapter before enabling coordinated worker
execution. The actual coordinated Mac package uses the legacy `Mentra Release`
layout; the private importer must verify it and use its reviewed host installer,
never execute bundled application scripts. Preserve schema1 PR import behavior.

Core/admin progress must accept this discriminated schema2 source before enabling
`dev,staging` in `TEST_RUN_DISPATCH_CHANNELS`; its dispatch input names already match.
The first coordinated worker routine is `no-glasses`. Coordinated OTA/Call require
registered adapters and fixture qualifications. No staging or hardware verification
was performed for the public source adapter.

## Nightly OTA then Call sequence

The opt-in `nightly-device-routines.yml` workflow selects one immutable publication
per dev/staging channel at Los Angeles midnight. The two UTC schedules account for
DST. Leave `DEVICE_ROUTINE_NIGHTLY_ENABLED` unset until the matching private workflow
is merged, dispatch credentials are installed and the fixture/network paths qualify.

Each channel job creates two separate schema2 request generations through the trusted
`dev` issuer. Both use the same exact build run and publication attempt. Their optional
`sequence` marker is `{kind: "nightly-ota-call", runId, runAttempt: 1, member}`; `member`
is the request routine (`day1-ota` or `mentra-call`) and the run identifies the public
nightly source. The producer authenticates that source's repository, schedule event,
workflow path, dev branch and entered channel send step. The ordinary completed-request
callback skips marked members, including no-artifact results; malformed markers fail.
Manual PR and coordinated requests without the marker keep their existing behavior.

The channel job waits up to eight minutes for both acknowledged request runs and
validates their exact attempt, successful completion and unique immutable artifact.
It downloads each request, verifies the trusted producer identities, authenticates
both complete published selections and requires exact selection equality. It then
sends one private `nightly-device-routines.yml` job with only the source repository
and the OTA/Call request run IDs and attempts. The private job independently validates
these artifacts and owns the ordered OTA result, recovery and Call eligibility check.
Each member retains its own request, claim and recorded result.

The entered channel send step is the durable duplicate fence, including legacy
individual nightly send jobs for that date/channel. An ambiguous acknowledgement,
failed request, missing artifact or readiness timeout never causes an automatic resend.
Workflow reruns refuse dispatch. Retain the original history and reconcile it manually;
creating or deleting another workflow run is not an authorization to repeat hardware
work. A failed channel does not prevent the other eligible channel from proceeding.


## Private dispatch authentication

The trusted public callback and nightly workflows mint short-lived installation
tokens from the organization-owned GitHub App. Configure repository variable
`TEST_RUN_GITHUB_APP_ID` and secret `TEST_RUN_GITHUB_APP_PRIVATE_KEY` for that App,
which must be installed on `Mentra-Community/Mentra-Automated-Testing`. The App
installation needs Actions write; each token explicitly selects only that private
repository and Actions write (plus GitHub's implicit metadata permission).

Both workflows pin `actions/create-github-app-token` v3 to
`bcd2ba49218906704ab6c1aa796996da409d3eb1`. Minting occurs after the request artifacts
are downloaded, immediately before private dispatch. The nightly eight-minute
readiness wait therefore does not consume token lifetime. Tokens expire after one
hour, longer than the complete ten-minute callback and twenty-minute nightly jobs,
and the action revokes them on job completion by default. Hardware execution in the
private workflow obtains its own credentials; no public token crosses jobs.

The key is available only to the default-branch callback/scheduled code, checked out
at `github.workflow_sha`; the PR request workflow does not receive it. There is no
static `E2E_PRIVATE_DISPATCH_TOKEN` or PAT fallback. Changing token acquisition does
not change request identities, shared claims, send-history fences or the prohibition
on retrying an ambiguous workflow dispatch.
